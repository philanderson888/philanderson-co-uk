<h3>Introduction...</h3>

<p>Classes are a good way of selecting a big or small part of a page, and then, changing it. I am using classes right now.! What I am doing is I made a div and gave it the class "intro". Then in the style tag I did .intro{
[code here] } and I added the code.You can right click and view source if your on chrome and you want to look at how I made this page from editor. So thats the intro!.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 1</h3>
<p>You can use CSS classes with any HTML element! However, what happens if we had already defined a value for the default tag. would this cause any problems for classes of the paragraph tag?

Well, when this happens the CSS class for any tag will override the default CSS. If the CSS class uses a CSS attribute already defined by the default CSS, then the formatting defined by the class will be the value that is used.

It may be easier to imagine that the CSS for a generic HTML element is the starting point and the only way to change that look is to overwrite the attributes using CSS classes. Please see the example below for a visual of this tricky topic.</p>
