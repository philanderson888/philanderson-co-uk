Diameter: A line that passes through the center of a circle and divides it in half.
Equilateral: A term used to describe a shape whose sides are all of equal length.
Linear Equation: An equation that contains two variables and can be plotted on a graph as a straight line.
Proper Fraction: A fraction whose denominator is greater than its numerator.
Supplementary Angles: Two angles are supplementary if their sum is equal to 180°.
Complementary Angles: Two angles that together equal 90°.
Prime Numbers: NUMBERS that are only divisible by themselves and 1.
Numerator: The top number in a fraction. The numerator is divided into equal parts by the denominator.
Midpoint: A point that is exactly halfway between two locations.
Average: The average is the same as the mean. Add up a series of numbers and divide the sum by the total number of values to find the average.
