# General facts
- Independent variable - some thing that we change
- Dependent variable - something that we measure
- Control variable - something that doesn't change
- How can we increase the rate of diffusion
    • The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of diffusion (this is because the particles have more energy)
    • The shorter the distance particles have to travel, the faster they will move
    • Concentration gradient - the bigger the difference between the number of particles in one area to another
- Renewable energy - energy that can be reused and wont run out (e.g. wind or solar power)

# Bones, Muscles and Joints
- Bones and muscles allow the body to move,
- Our skeleton supports our body and gives it shape
- Our bones have joints between them so they can move
- Red blood cells and white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow of some bones
- Muscles are what keeping the body standing up

**Smooth Muscle**
    Involuntary (can't control)
    Occurs in internal organs and blood vessels
**Cardiac Muscle**
    Involuntary
    Occurs in the heart
**Skeletal Muscle**
    Voluntary
    Attached to the skeleton

- Joints are where bones are joined together to create the skeleton
- There are 3 main joints in the body
    • Hinge joints				(e.g. elbow joints)
    • Ball and socket joints		(e.g. hip/shoulder joints)
    • Pivot joints
- Muscles work in pairs
    • When one muscle contracts (gets shorter and fatter), the other muscle relaxes (gets longer and thinner).
    • This allows the bones to move

# Forces
- Force (n) = Mass (kg) x 9.8 (force of gravity on earth)
- Speed = Distance / Time
- Distance = Speed x Time
- Time = Distance / Speed

# Cells
- A cell is a tiny unit that all living things are made of
    • Millions of cells make a tissue, a tissue makes an organ, and organ make an organ system
- Animal Cell parts
    • Nucleus - controls the cells activities
    • Cytoplasm - chemical reactions take place here
    • Cell membrane - controls what goes in and out of the cell
    • Mitochondria - to take nutrients and produce the energy needed to power the biochemical reactions of the cell
- Plant Cell parts
    • Nucleus - controls the cells activities
    • Vacuole - help in the storage and disposal of various substances
    • Chloroplast - use the sun's energy, carbon dioxide and water to make sugars and oxygen
    • Cell membrane - controls what goes in and out
    • Cell wall - provides support and structure for a plant cell, giving it a rectangular shape which is quite rigid
    • Plasmids - manufacturing and storing of food

# Elastic energy
- Elastic energy - when an object is bouncy, flexible or comes back to you (e.g. spring, bouncy ball)
- Elastic energy is stored when an elastic material is stretched or compressed
- Any object that is raised off the ground has gravitational potential energy (G.P.E)
    • GPE = mass x height x 10
- If an object moves, it has kinetic energy (KE)
    • KE = ½ x mass x speed^2


# Energy transfer
- Law of conservation of energy
    • Energy can be stored, transferred or dissipated (spread into surroundings), it can never be created or destroyed
- The scientific unit for energy is the joule, which has the symbol J
- Different energy stores
    • Chemical energy store - The energy stored in chemical bonds, such as those between molecules.
    • Kinetic potential energy store - energy of a moving object
    • Gravitational potential energy store - energy of object at height
    • Thermal energy store - heat
    • Elastic energy store - energy stored when object is squashed or stretched
    • Electrostatic energy store - The energy stored when repelling charges have been moved closer together or when attracting charges have been pulled further apart.
    • Nuclear energy store - energy stored in nucleus of atom
    • Magnetic energy store - The energy stored when repelling poles have been pushed closer together or when attracting poles have been pulled further apart.
- Energy can transfer/move from one store to another in different ways. It can be transferred 
    • By heating - energy transferred from hotter object to cooler
    • Mechanically - occurs through the action of a force
    • Electrically - energy is transferred through the movement of charge through a potential difference
    • By radiation - the transfer of heat energy through space by electromagnetic radiation.
- Power (watt, W) = energy transferred (joules, J) / time (seconds, s)
    • Power (p) = Energy (e) / Time (t)
    • Energy (e) = Power (p) x Time (t) 
    • Time (t) = Energy (e) / Power (p)


# Electricity 
- 3 types of fossil fuels
    • Coal is non-renewable, burned for fuel to generate electricity
    • Natural gas is non-renewable
    • Oil is non-renewable

# Science facts
- The oceans produce the majority of the oxygen on earth
- The human stomach is so powerful that it can dissolve razor blades
- Water can boil and freeze at the same tim
- An indiviual blood cell takes around one minute to go around your body
- There are creatures with 'indetermediate growth' meaning they never stop growing

# Filtration and Distilliation
Filtration separates insolube solids from liquids, you could use evaporation or cystallisation
  - Insoluble means can't be dissolved
  - Soluble means can be dissolved

Simple distilliation is used to separate liquids from a solution
Fractional distilliation is used to separate a mixture of liquids
