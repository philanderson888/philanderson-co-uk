### Section 1 - The Economic Problem
Four factors of Production - Labour, Capital, Enterprise and Land
Product Posibility Frontiers (PPF) - Graph showing maximum output of available options
Free market - Allocates resources based on supply and demand and price mechanism
Command economy - Government decives how resources should be allocated.
Ceteris paribus - Latin for "all other things remaining equal" when doing experiments as an economist.
Positive statement - Objective statements that can be tested as they are based off evidence - Facts
Normative statement - Subjective statements with a judgement - Opinions
Types of economic agents - Producers, consumers and governments
Land - The natural resources.
Labour - The people who work.
Capital - Equipment used in producing goods and services (factories)
Enterprise - The entrepreneurs who are willing to take a risk to make profit by setting up businesses.
Public sector - Owned by government
Private sector - Businesses set up by individuals
Marginal utitlity - Benefit gained from consuming one additional unit of a good
Total utility - Overall benefit from consuming a good
Law of diminishing marginal utility - For each extra unit thats consumed, the marginal utility gained decreases.  
Rationality - Reasons for the actions of economic agents. Weigh the costs, benefits and alternatives to maximise their gain.
Rules of thumb - Choosing middle-price option when presented with a range of prices for similar products
Anchoring - Placing too much emphasis on one piece of information
Availability bias - Judgements made based on probability of an event from previous instances. (Storm yearly so its expected)
Social norms - Someone can be influenced by a social group (friends, family, the whole country or world)
Habitual behaviour - Doing the same thing all the time despite rational reasons of doing something different (Brand loyalty)




### Section 2 - Competitive Markets
Demand - Quantity of something consumers are willing to pay a price for at a particular time.
Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) - How the quantity demanded responds to its change in price.
Income Elasticity of Demand (YED) - How demand changes with change in real income
YED formula - % change in quantity demanded / % change in real income
Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED) - How quantity demanded responds to another goods change in price.
Joint Supply - Production of something involves the production of another thing.
Market equilibrium - Supply = Demand


### Section 3 - Business Economics
Specialisation - Leads to division of labour as different workers have different skills
Marginal cost - Extra cost from producing the final unit of output. Cost of 'one more unit'
Law of Diminishing returns - If one variable facotr is increased while others stay fixed, marginal returns will begin to decrease
Average product - Output produced per unit of factor input
Demerger - Breaking up of a firm into separate firms, so each one can focus on a specific market.


### Section 4 - Market Structures
Price descrimination - Charging different prices to different customers for the same product. Three stages
Oligopoly - Market thats dominated by a few interdependent firms, competing intensely


### Section 5 - Market failure
Merit Goods - Benefit society more than private benefits
Demerit Goods - Opposite of merit goods
Symmetric information - Everyone has same knowledge in the market (seller and buyer)


### Section 6 - Government Issues
Price controls - Government can set a min./max. price for a good or service.
Competition Polity - Governments try to avoid monopolies forming in markets
Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) - Insurance to repay debt if borrower is unable to do so.
Government Intervention - Governments putting in regulations or helping consumer decisions
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) - Helps farmers by collecting market failure from fluctuating prices. Failed.


### Section 7 - The Labour Market
Monopsony - Only one buyer in a market.
Trade union - Organisation to represent the interests of a group of workers. Usually to bargain with employers
Wage discrimination - Price discrimination but with wages, workers usually paid by job/willingness to work.
Incentives - Given to people to encourage them to work.
Demographic changes - Changes in the features of a population (age, lifestyle, gender)
Collective bargaining - Trade union negotiate with an employer. Can be on a national level (all) or plant level (one workplace)
Productivity bargains - Unions agree to changes for higher productivity, with also higher wages or other benefits.
Equilibrium wage rate - Amount of labour decreases to be equal to the wage rate because trade unions ask for higher wages.
Bilateral monopoly - Only one buyer and one seller


### Section 8 - Measuring Economic Performance
Four Macroeconomic indicators - Rate of economic growth, inflation, unemployment, balance of payments
Inflation - Sustained rise in average price of things over a time period or a fall in value of money.
Retail Price Index (RPI) - Measure for inflation, what people spend their money on
Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Measure for inflation, similar to RPI but excludes things like council tax.


### Section 9 - Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
Aggregate Demand - Total spending on goods and services
AD formula - Consumption + Investment + Government spending + (Exports - Imports)
Aggregate Supply - Total output produced in an economy.
Macroeconomic Equilibrium - AS = AD


### Section 10 - Government Economic Policy objectives
Full employment - Everyone of working age who wants to work has a job.
Structural unemployment - From a decline in certain industries, usually from a change in consumer interests.
Frictional unemployment - Unemployment from leaving one job and finding another, the time it takes.
Real wage unemployment - Real wages being pushed above equal level of employment
Balance of Payments (BOP) - Records all flows of money in/out of a country
Natural rate of unemployment (NRU) - Rate of unemployment when labour market is in equilibrium
Lorenz curves - Graphically represent the distribution of income
Equity - Being fair, different people have different circumstances. People get what they need
Relative poverty - Having low income in comparison to others income.
Absolute poverty - Unable to access/buy basic needs (food, shelter)


### Section 11 - Macroeconomic Policy Instruments
Fiscal policy - Involves government spending and taxation.
Cyclical budget position - Governments short-term fiscal stance.
Structural budget position - Governments long-term fiscal stance.
Monetary policy - Involves making decisions about interest, money supply and exchange rates. Affects AD.
Supply-side policies - To increase the economy's trend growth rate/productive potential.


### Section 12 - The Financial Sector
Money Markets - For short term finance
Capital Markets - Medium and Long-term finance by issuing bonds and shares.
Foreign Exchange markets - For international trade and investment.
Market bubbles - A big gap in the price of assets bought and price sold creates this
Market rigging - When traders on financial markets, cooperate secretly to manipulate markets to make profits.
Speculation - Aiming to make a profit by buying assets cheaply and selling at a higher price.
Central Banks - Act as a lender of last resort to other banks. A 'banker to the banks'
Regulation of Financial Markets - In the UK, done by the Bank of England and FCA. Globally, the IMF and WB.


### Section 13 - The Global Economy
Trade liberalisation - Reduction of tariffs and restriction on international trade.
Opportunity cost - Next best alternative thats given up to do something, a sacrifice. AKA. Comparative advantage
Terms of trade - Relative price of exports to imports. Measured as a %.
Free trade - Unrestriced national trade
Quotas - Can be used to set limits to amount of imports of certain goods.
Trading blocs - Agreements between countries/governments about trade, reducing trade barriers.
Economic integration - Economies of different countries become more closely linked.
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) - Has a monetary policy, coordinates fiscal and economic policies and a common currency - the euro
Fixed exchange rate - Government sets the exchange rate
Floating exchange rate - Free to move with changing supply of /demand for a currency.


### Section 14 - Economic Development
Commodities - Primary products - i.e. taken directly from the earth.
Inward-looking strategies - Try to protect domestic industries until they're ready to compete internationally.
Microfinance - Small loans to businesses and individuals for them to become more financially independent.
Sustainability - Meeding needs of today without intefering with the needs of the future.
