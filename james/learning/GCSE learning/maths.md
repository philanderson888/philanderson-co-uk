- Random word list
  
  ```
  Congruent - when two shapes are identical in shape and angles and form.
  Parallel - two lines that are straight and never meet
  Polygon - a polygon  is a plane figure that is formed by three or more straight lines called
  sides because no shape has two or one sides.
  Perpendicular - A line that is at a 90-degree angle on a line that makes a right angle
  Right angle - A 90-degree angle 
  Acute angle - An angle below 90-degrees
  Obtuse angle - An angle above 90-degrees but below 180-degrees
  Reflex angle - An angle above 180-degrees but below 360-degrees
  Perimeter - Length of all the sides on a shape added together
  Rounding - When a number is either 1,2,3 or 4 you round down (back to zero) when its
  either 5,6,7,8 or 9, you round up (up to the next ten/hundred/thousand)
  Area of a square formula = A=s2 (the area is the sides squared)
  Area of a rectangle = b x h (base x height)
  Area of a parallelogram = b x h (base x height)
  Area of a triangle = 1/2 b x h  (base x height times divided by 2)
