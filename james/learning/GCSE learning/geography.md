    - Global Atmospheric Circulation
        
        Global = Earth
        
        Atmospheric = The air above our heads
        
        Circulation = The circular movement of air around the earth, known as cells. These cells join together and move heat.
        
        - Describe how sunlight intensity varies across the globe (2)
            
            **It is hotter at the equator because the curvature of the earth makes the solar radiation have to pass through more of the atmosphere at higher latitudes, which reduces the energy. It is more concentrated at the equator as it is the closest to the suns rays. (2)**
            
            - Latitude - Measurement of distance in degrees south or north of the equator.
        
        **Hot air rises - Low pressure and it is wet and stormy weather**
        
        **Cold air sinks - High pressure and it is clear and dry weather**
        
        Coriolis effect - Causes winds to turn right north of the equator and left south of the equator, due to the Earths rotation.
        
        - Explanation
            
            Warm air rises at the equator
            
            As it rises it cools and moisture within the air condenses and forms cloud and rain.
            
            Because the air is rising the pressure is low
            
            Air cools as it moves away from the equator
            
            At about 30 degrees north/south the cold air falls towards the earth surface.
            
            As it does it tends to warm and tends to reduce rainfall
            
            Pressure in these areas tends to be high
            
            Once the air reaches the surface, pressure differences cause air to move along the surface back towards the equator.
            
        - Different cells
            - Ferrel cell - At 60 degrees North and South of the equator, the surface air meets colder air from the poles, which causes it to rise, creating a belt of low pressure. This air either moves back towards the equator or the poles.
            - Hadley cell - At the equator, air is warm. This air rises as its less dense.  The hot air tries to move back to the poles. At about 30 degrees North/South it cools and sinks, going back to the equator.
            - Polar cell - At the two poles there is a band of high pressure, and the cold air sinks to the equator.
    - Formation of tropical storms
        - Tropical storms form at low latitudes between 5-30 degrees.
        - The ocean temperature needs to be 27 degrees for a tropical storm to form
        - In the northern hemisphere they spin anti-clockwise and clockwise in the Southern due to Coriolis effect.
        - Order of how they form
            - Warm, moist air above the ocean rises, creating an area of low pressure
            - Surrounding cooler air is drawn into the area of low pressure, causing winds
            - The cool drawn-in air now warms up and takes moisture, causing it to rise
            - The large mass of rising, warm air cools and condenses, forming large cumulonimbus clouds and heavy rain.
            - Latent heat released during condensation helps to power the storm
            
    - Typhoon Haiyan
        
        Typhoon Haiyan was in the Phillipines, 3 Nov - 11 Nov 2013
        
        **Primary impact - Direct result of natural hazard**
        
        **Secondary impact - Occur as a result of primary impact**
        
        - Measuring hurricanes
            
            The measure typhoons/hurricanes with a Saffir-Simpson scale.
            
            It tells the wind speed and storm surge in feet.
            
            There are 5 categories

    - Tornadoes
        
        We categorise tornadoes using the Fujita tornado scale. (USA 1920 - 1998)

        - How tornadoes form:
            - Ground temperature increases, moist air is heated and rises.
            - The warm moist air punctures the layer of cold dry air above it. A thunder cloud may form.
            - A storm quickly develops.

        - Upwards movements of air can become rapid. Winds from different directions cause it to rotate.
        - A cone or funnel drops out of the clouds
            - The vortex of wind varies in size and shape.
            - A tornado can last several seconds to more than an hour.
        
    - UK’s Heatwave
        
        Heatwave - A prolonged period of abnormally hot weather
        
        Was in 2018, the joint hottest year on record
        
        The UK’s highest temperature  ever recorded was 38.5 degrees in August 2003.
        
        The Uk’s hot temperature in 2018 in Faversham, Kent was 35.3 degrees.
        
        The average temperature was 15.8 degrees
        
    - Great storm on 1987
        
        **Depression** caused the storm
        
        **Depression is an area of low pressure which moves from west to east in the Northern hemisphere. Winds blow anti-clockwise in a depression along the isobars. You can work out the wind direction by following the isobars. Where warm air meets cold air, the warm air is pushed upwards where it cools, condenses and precipitates.**
        
        Frontal rainfall - Warm air forced to rise over cold air and rains heavily alont the front
