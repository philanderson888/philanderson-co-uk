## Year 9/10 Revision
                    
- Random Vocabulary
  
  ```
  Cell - what makes up living things
  Nucleus - Main part of a cell
  Cytoplasm - The semi-fluid in a cell
  Vacuole - Main part of a Plant cell
  Mitochondria - Small parts in a cell
  Cell membrane - The edge of an animal cell
  Cell wall - the edge of a plant cell
  Diffusion - process of particles travelling from an area of high concentration to
  an area of low concentration
  Osmosis - Diffusion in water, there are three types of osmosis; Isotonic, hypotonic
  and hypertonic.
  ```
  
- Genes
  - Natural selection
      - Continuous variation
          
          This type of variation is difficult to group. There are some extreme examples and most people fall in the middle. Some examples are height and weight.
          
          These are represented on a line graph.
          
      - Discontinuous variation
          
          This type of variation is easier to group. Groups have hard borders and you cannot fall between groups. Some examples are sex and blood group
          
          Discontinuous data can be represented on a bar or pie chart.
          
      - Variation
          
          Animals in the same species vary because of their slightly different genes
          
          For example, not all cheetas can run at the same speed. Some are slightly faster and some are slower than others.
          
          This is to do with the genes that control muscle size, aerodynamic head shape and so on.
          
      - Competition
          - Because of the differences, some cheetas are better adapted to survive.
              - They find it easier to hunt, eat and live to an older age so that they can breed.
          - If they are more likely to breed, those genes that made them such good hunters will be passed onto their offspring.
          - The cheetahs that were slow don’t survive, and don’t pass on the genes for slowness or poor aerodynamics.
          - Over time, the cheetah population is refined and becomes better suited to its environment.
  - Relationships between Organisms
      - Organisms in the same habitat
          
          Organisms are dependent on one another for a wide range of reasons:
          
          - They provide a food source (any organism that is consumed)
          - They help with pollination (insects such as bees)
          - They provide shelter (some species of tree)
      - Pollination
          
          Humans depend on pollination more than others considering how we farm crops for large-scale agriculture and consumption.
          
      - Negative Impacts
          - Some organisms can affect their environment and often impact other species negatively.
          - An example is:
              - When a species over hunts a particular population causing them to die out - this can have implications for other organisms.
      - Human impacts
          - If pollutants from humans make it into the environment, this can cause an accumulation of toxins in certain apex predators.
          - This can kill the predators.
          - Large-scale destruction of habitats (e.g. cutting down a rainforest) can have a huge effect on the organisms who live in that environment.
  
- Revision 2
  - Catalysts and Enzymes
      - A catalyst speeds up a reaction without being used up. It can be used over and over again.
      - Lock and Key theory
          
          This is a theory that each substrate can fit into a certain enzyme that has an active site (A gap where the substrate can fit into). Like one key can fit in one lock to unlock it.
          
          E + S → ES → EP → E + P
          
      - Proteins
          - **Proteins - They build up tissues and make up enzymes**
          - Protein rich foods include meat, fish, pulses and cheese.
          - Proteins are sequences of units called amino acids
          - Proteins can denature of the **temperature** is **too high** or **pH** is **too high or low**
      - Digestion of Proteins
          - There are **20 natural amino acids**
          - Proteins are broken down by protease
          - Protein is 3 amino acids long, so the **max combination is 20³ = 8000**. (20 different amino acids)
          - Amino acids are **covalently bonded** in a protein
          - Proteins are folded, coiled and twisted giving a **unique 3D shape.**
          - When a protein loses its shape it becomes **denatured**
      - Metabolism - All the reactions that happen in a cell/the body
      - Anabolism - Building up large molecules from smaller ones, opposite of digestion.
      - Catabolic - Breaking up (one → many)
      - Isomerisation - They change one molecule into another (one → one)
      
- Revision 3 - Year 10 - Blood Vessels and the Heart

          - Wasted Carbon dioxide to the lungs
          - Urea from liver to kidneys
          - Digested nutrients to cell
      - Red Blood cells - Biconcave disks, no nucleus, packed with red haemoglobin that carries oxygen to the body cells
      - White Blood cells - Part of the body’s defence against microorganisms

      - Circulatory System - Transports substances to/from body cell. Made up of
          - Blood
          - Blood vessels
          - The Heart
      - The three main blood vessels:
          - Arteries - Carry blood away from the heart at high pressure
          - Veins - Carry blood back to your heart, Valves are used to stop blood flow
          - Capillaries - Network of tiny, thin vessels
      - Coronary Arteries - Blood vessels that supply heart with oxygen
      - Aerobic Respiration - Process by which all living things get energy from Glucose and Oxygen
          
          Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water 
          
- Revision
- Nutrıtıon
  - Balanced diets
      
      There are seven key parts to a healthy diet:
      
      Carbohydrates - An energy source
      
      Lipids (fats) - An energy source
      
      Proteins - for growth and repair of tissues
      
      Vitamins - help prevent deficiency diseases
      
      Minerals - are needed for key chemicals in your body.
      
      Fibre - helps keep you regular and avoid constipation
      
      Water - so you can stay hydrated
      
  - Deficiency diseases
      
       If you lack a significant amount of particular nutrients you may develop a particular disease. Examples of deficiency diseases include:
      
      - Scurvy - This comes from not eating enough vitamin C. It causes issues in your connective tissues.
          
          Scurvy is caused by a vitamin C deficiency
          
          The body cant make enough collagen which can lead to bleeding and swollen gums, tiredness and muscle pain.
          
      
      Rickets - This comes from not eating enough vitamin D. This vitamin is vital for bone development so not consuming enough will lead to a softening of your bones. Rickets gives you bowed legs.
      
      Goitre - This comes from not eating enough iodine. The thyroid gland in your neck swells up.
      
      - Anaemia - This comes from not eating enough iron. It is where you dont have enough red blood cells. Iron is a key component of haemoglobin, the chemical that transports oxygen around your body. This is why blood has a metallic taste.
          
          Anaemia is caused by a lack of iron in the diet or blood loss.
          
          The body cant make enough haemoglobin and red blood cells, which leads to tiredness, pale skin and shortness of breath 
          
      
      Kwashiorkor - This is caused by severe protein deficiency. The body cant grow and repair its tissues, and the immune system becomes weak. It can also cause stunted growth and a swollen belly.
      
  
  If you consume too many calories you are likely to become obese, or overweight. If you consume too few calories you are likely to become underweight. The average amount of energy a man must eat in a day is 2,500 kcal. The average amount of energy a woman must eat in a day is 2,000 kcal.
