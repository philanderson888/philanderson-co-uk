    - Roanoke
        - It happened in 1555 and 1585
        - Sir Walter Raleigh wanted to colonise on Roanoke
        - He put all his supplies on the ship called Tiger
        - It was a big mistake because the Tiger got destroyed
        - The Elizabethan ship also arrived at Roanoke
        - The Native Americans were at Roanoke, they welcomed the English
        - Some of the problems Sir Walter Raleigh had were:
            
            How will i pay for the Colony?
            
            How will i persuade people to go?
            
            Who would lead the colony?
            
        - The reason why the English settlement failed at Roanoke was because of very bad decisions, such as to put all the supplies on the Tiger that was destroyed by a storm, Puerto Rico, and nowhere near enough seeds and other provisions were packed
        - This was probably the most important reason for the failure of the settlement, because if the English were better prepared, they couldve survived without Native American help.
    - James Wolfe 1759
        
        ```
        The Historical equation = Battle of Quebec 1759 -> 13 Colonies + Canada
        
        By 1759, France wanted control of the British thirteen colonies. These colonies
        provided Britain with wool, for clothing, crops and food to eat, wood and stone
        to build with and plenty of slaves.
        
        The Thirteen Colonies in the new world of America were, therefore, very 
        important to Britain. Not so much Spain in the south, but France to the North,
        threatened these colonies.
        
        1) The Battle of Quebec in 1759 was part of a bigger war called **The Seven Years
        War (1756 - 1763)** - a truly world war between Britain and France.
        
        2) A lot of pressure was put on young James Wolfe by the British because he was
        the young who led the British in 1759. James Wolfe was only 32 years old.
        
        3) Quebec was also at the mouth of the St.Lawrence river. This river was very
        important for trade and commerse such as logging, animal furs and trading with 
        the colonies.
        
        4) The 13 colonies were English and the people who lived there were frightened of
        the French to the North and they were also frightened of the Spanish to the South.
        The colonists were protestant while the French and the Spanish were catholic.
        
        5) Quebec was heavily defendant by thousands of French soldiers under the command
        of General Montcalm
        
        6) Quebec is situated/located on top of a sheer cliff called **The Heights Of 
        Abraham.**
        
        7)How was James Wolfe going to attack Quebec when it was a cliff? There was an
        easier attack route crossing the Plains of Abraham but it would take longer.
        
        8) If James Wolfe went up to the Heights of Abraham, he could lose a lot of men
        but it would be quicker.
        
        9) The Battle of Quebec occured in September 1759
        
        10) At the beginning of the battle James Wolfe decides to attack the French using
        the shorter route up the **Heights of Abraham** (the cliff).
        
        11) This meant his men climbing up the cliff. He needed fitter soldiers to do this
        
        12) There was a longer route to Quebec. This was a gentler but longer slope to 
        Quebec called the **Plains of Abraham.** 
        
        13) General Montcalm was the French commander. He believed the English would never
        attack up the cliff so he allowed many French soldiers to leave their post at the
        top of the cliff in order to help local farmers with the harvest.
        
        14) So when James Wolfe and his men had climbed up the cliff there we not many
        French soldiers there.
        
        15) The French soldiers panicked whilst the British didn't.
        
        16) James Wolfe was wounded himself and he would die from his wounds after the 
        British won.

- WW1 Revision 1: Causes of WW1
    - Information
        
        WW1 was a World War between 1914 - 1918.
        
        In 1871 regions united to form Germany.
        
        The leader of Germany was known as The Kaiser.
        
    - Causes of WW1
        - Alliances
            
            An alliance is two or more people/groups/countries becoming a team with each other in an agreement.
            
            The Alliances in WW1 were called; The Triple Entente (Britain, France and Russia), and The Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy).
            
        - German nationalism
            
            German nationalism was a cause of WW1 because of growing German power. This is because Germany took French land including Alsace Lorraine.
            
        - Imperialism
            
            Colony - Part of an empire, been taken over by another country

            - The Scramble for Africa
                
                The Scramble for Africa was Germany, France and Britain trying to colonise parts of Africa.
                
                Africa was an ideal place to build an empire because it was rich in natural resources but very weak industrially and militarily, making it easy to imperialise.
                
                Germany didnt get as much land of Africa and the land she got werent as rich in natural resources as the land Britain and France had.
                
                Germany attempted to take parts of Africa from France (Morroco).
                
        - The arms race
            
            The arms race was a race to build up their army and weapons to get more power.
            
            This race was between quite a few countries such as, Germany, France, Britain, Austria, Russia and Italy.
            
            Navy - Warships and the army on the sea.
            
            - The navy race
                
                A competition for biggest navy and war weapons at sea.
                
                Britain had the largest empire
                
                Britain had the largest navy.
                
                Germany wanted a navy that could match Britain
                
                Britain built The Dreadnought in 1906 - Most powerful ship in the world.
                
        - Balkans
            - southern Europe
            - Slavs
            
            Austria were scared Slavs living in the Austrian empire would want to break away and join Serbia. They decided to show that they still had control over the region by taking over a part of Serbia's neighbour called Bosnia.
            
            Serbia then asked Russia for support against the Austrians.
            
            Russia were allies with Serbia as the Slavs both had the same religions and spoke the same language.
            
            The Russians were worried by Austria taking over Bosnia, but in 1908 they weren't fully prepared so they encouraged Serbia to expand its own land in the Balkans. They took over Bulgaria and Albania. 
            
            By 1914 the Serbians felt they could fight free all the Slavs living in Austria.
            
            Russia informed Serbia that they were strong enough to help Serbia now.
            
            - The Balkans crisis
                
                The Balkans could lead to war because Serbia might launch and attack on Austria Hungary. Russia might help Serbia. Germany might step in as they are allied  with Austria Hungary. Germany might then use the Schlieffen plan. This would mean that before they attack Russia they must attack France.
                
            - The Schlieffen plan
                
                The Schlieffen plan was a plan made by Von Schlieffen because Germany felt threatened and surrounded by France and Russia, who are at both sides of Germany.
                
                The Schlieffen plan was that whilst Russia were still mobilizing their army, Germany would attack France through Belgium, and flank them.
                
                However this brought Britain into the war because they had to go through Belgium who were accompanied by Britain.
                
        - Assassination of Franz Ferdinand and consequences

            - Archduke Franz Ferdinand's anniversary
            - Gavrilo Princip shot Franz Ferdinand and his wife from only a few feet away

            - Russia mobilize their army.
            - Germany warns Russia to stop

            - Britain tells Germany to withdraw troops from Belgium.
            - Germany refuses and Britain declare war on Germany.
    - Nationalism
        
        Nationalism is strongly identifying with your own nation. Supporting your nations interests, often at the expense of other nations.
        
    - Interpretation A
        
        WW1 started because of Austria's aggression towards Serbia. If Austria had not shown such aggression towards Serbia WW1 would not have happened.
        
    - Interpretation B
        
        WW1 started because of Germany. Germany brought uncommitted ( countries that were not involved) countries into WW1.

        - Very muddy and uncomfortable
- Exam question:
    
    **How far do you agree with Interpretation B? About the causes of WW1? Explain your answer using both interpretations and your knowledge.**
    
    Interpretation B says that WW1 was caused by Germany. It also says that the reason why is because Germany brang in uncommited (countries that were not involved) countries into WW1.
    
    I slightly agree with this interpretation of the cause of WW1 because I know that Germany declared war on Russia for mobilizing their army to help Serbia. Russia was in an alliance with France so Germany used the Schlieffen plan, which brings both Belgium and France into the war as she invaded France through Belgium. Germany did this whilst Russia were still mobilizing their army so she could not help France. This brings Britain into the war as they were helping Belgium.
    
    I also disagree with this interpretation because I know that Austria declared war on Serbia as Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was heir to the throne, was assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, a young Serbian who hated the Austro-Hungarian empire. Russia were mobilizing their army to help Serbia but they refused to stop when Germany warned them, causing Germany to declare war on Russia. Therefore, Germany was just trying to help their ally, Austria-Hungary by telling Russia to stop; but Russia were helping Serbia, so they refused. This made Germany use the Schlieffen plan, as France was allied with Russia, but Belg
    
    I agree with some parts of this interpretation but other parts I do not.
    
    Interpretation A disagrees with interpretation B as it states Austria is culpable whereas B says Germany is to blame. It also states that the reason why is because Austria was so aggressive to Serbia for murdering the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.
    
    Overall interpretation A is correct about the causes of WW1 because they attacked Serbia which caused Russia to accompany them which then brought in Germany who brought in Belgium and France with the Schlieffen plan, bringing in Britain to help Belgium.
