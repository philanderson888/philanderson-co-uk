- Operating Systems
    
    An operating system is system software.
    
    An operating system is the most important software on a computer. It manages the memory, processes, software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with a computer without knowing the computers language.
    
    - GUI
        
        A GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. Its how we interact with the computer, without it we would just see binary. Its how we use programs and access the internet.
        
    - Types of Operating Systems
        
        Windows (Desktop/server/mobile)
        
        MAC OS X (Unix) (Desktop/server)
        
        Apple iOS (Mobile)
        
        Ubuntu (Linux) (Desktop Server)
        
        Android (Mobile)
        
    
    Open Source and Closed source. Open source is when you can modify it and closed is when you are not allowed to modify the code.
    
    - Firmware and drivers
        
        Firmware is the software that runs on the device. Like a printer.
        
        A driver is the software that tells your operating system how to communicate with the device.

        Integer division = division without remainder (5 DIV = 2)
        
        Modulo operator = Remainder (5 MOD 2 = 1)
