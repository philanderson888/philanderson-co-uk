They have a round head, a narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a trait rare among mammals.";
