#### Microscopy
#### Osmosis - sugar concentration in potato cells
1. Cut equal size cylinders from same potato and remove skin. Remove excess water from surface. Weigh with top-ban balance
2. Place each cylinder in test tube with different sugar concentration solutions, leave for a set time (day). Water moves in/out cells - osmosis.
3. After a day, remove cylinders, dab off excess water, reweigh and calculate % change of mass (difference/original x 100)
4. Plot graph of % change against concentration. X-axis intercept = sugar concentration of potato.
#### Enzymes - find optimum pH/temperature of enzyme
1. Measure substrate and enzyme - measuring cylinder. Place separately in a water bath, add a buffer solution to enzyme. Mix reactants together and start a timer.
2. Prepare a spotting tile with iodine drops in each tile. Every 30 seconds, remove a drop from enzyme mixture and drop into a tile. Keep going until no starch is present (no colour change) and calculate time.
3. Repeat process for multiple different pH buffers/temperatures.
4. Plot graph of time against ph/temp and draw line of best fit. Optimum condition is between two lowest points.






### B1 - Cell Structure and Transport
```
Cell - group of tissues working together
Nucleus - contains DNA for cell, controls cell
Cytoplasm - gel-like substance that fills cell, where chemical reactions happen
Mitochrondria - where respiration takes place due to enzymes, producing energy for cell
Ribosomes - protein is made for cell by proteinsynthesis
Cell membrane - controls what goes in/out of cell, and keeps contents of cell inside
Cell wall - provides structure and support for  cell
Vacoule - contains fluids like water and cell sap
Chloroplasts - produce energy via photosynthesis
Chlorophyll - green pigment inside chloroplasts that absorb light for photosynthesis
Diffusion - movement of molecules - from an area of high to low concentration. Doesn't require energy. Affected by: temperature, distance, concentration
Osmosis - movement of water molecules from an area of high to low concentration through a semi-permeable membrane - passive process
Active transport - movement of molecules from an area of low to high concentration - active process, requires energy
Bacterial cell - Cell membrane+Wall, Cytoplasm, ribosomes - single strand of free DNA - additional DNA on plasmids
```
#### Adaptations of exchanges
Single-celled organisms - can diffuse directly in/out cell across cell membrane: larger SA:Volume ratio - enough substances exchanged across membrane to supply volume of cell
Multi-cellular - smaller SA:V ratio - need an exchange surface for efficient diffusion
Exchange surfaces adaptations:
- thin membrane - short diffuse distance
- large SA - lots can diffuse at once
- Animals - many blood vessels - stuff in/out blood quickly
- Animals - ventilated - air moves in/out
Lungs - many alveoli - transfer oxygen to blood, remove CO2 from it
  - Breathing - keeps lungs ventilated with removal of C02 and entry of O2 - provides steep concentration
  - Good blood supply - removes carbon dioxide - steep concentration gradient
Alveoli: 
  - walls very thin - short diffusion distance. 
  - enormous surface area - (75m in humans).
  - moist lining for dissolving gases
  - good blood supply - covered in capillaries
Small intestine:
  - covered with villi & micro-villi - larger surface area - mitochrondria provide energy for active transport
  - single layer of surface cells
  - Long length - more time to absorb.
  - Digestive enzymes - bile help breakdown nutrients. 
  - Very good blood supply - transport up/down body - quick absorption     - active transport 
Leafs - CO2 diffuse into stomata, then into cells for photosynthesis. Adapted by:
  - Stomata - exchange surface - CO2 diffuses through - Oxygen & Water vapour diffuse out through stomata
  - Transpiration - (water vapour lost from all over surface, mainly through stomata) - water vapour evaporates inside leaf, diffuses to outside of leaf.
  - Guard cells - control water levels - close if lose water faster than being replaced by roots - without, plant would wilt
  - Flat shape - increases area of exchange surface - more effective
  - Cell walls - form another exchange surface - air spaces inside leaf increase area of surface - more chance for CO2
Gills:
  - gas exchange surface for fish 
  - Water enters mouth, passes out through gills. Oxygen diffuses into blood in gills, CO2 diffuses from blood into water
  - Thin plates (gill filaments) - big surface area - gas exchange
   - Gill filaments - made of lamellae - increase Surface Area even more
  - Lamellae - many capillaries - speed diffusion. Thin surface layer - minimise gas diffuse distance
  - lamallae - Blood flows one direction, water flows other direction - large concentration gradient
  - Concentration of oxygen in water higher than blood - as much oxygen as possible diffuse into blood 
### B2
```
Eukaryotic cells - complex cells with a nucleus.(plant & animal cells)
Prokaryotic cells - single-celled organisms with no nucleus, just DNA. Contains plasmids, flagella, pili, ribosomes,cytoplasm, cell membrane and wall and a nucleoid(DNA).
Cell diffentiation - process - cell changes to be specialised for job.
1) Sperm cells - Reproduction - long tail, streamlined head - help it swim. Lots of mitochrondria - provide energy. Enzymes in head to digest through egg membrane
2) Nerve cells - rapid signalling - long - cover more distance. Branched connections(axons) at ends to connect to other nerve cells & form a network
3) Muscle cell - contraction - long - space to contract. Lots of mitochrondria - generate energy for contraction.
4) Root hair cell - absorb water & nutrients - long hairs, stick out - big surface area for absorbing
5) Phloem & Xylem - transport substances - cells long, joined end to end. Xylem - hollow in centre, Phloem - few subcellular structures - substances can flow easily through them. Pores(perforated) in end walls - allow cell sap flow through.
 - Sieve tubes - perforated ends - cytoplasm connects cells.
Stem cells - undifferentiated cells found in bone marrow or embryos in body
Embryonic stem cells - can turn into any cell in the body - replace faulty cells, therapeutic cloning. However, ethical concerns, can get contaminated and make patients more ill.
Adult stem cells - can only become a limited number of cells, with specific functions. Less useful, but no ethical problems and safer.
Meristem - plant stem cells - found in tip of roots and shoots and inbetween xylem or phloem
Therapeutic cloning - using stem cells to clone organs for transplanting
Microscopes - eyepiece, objective lens, stage, coarse focus knob (Zoom in/out), fine focus knob(blur/focus), light
Binary fission - replication for prokaryotic cells - replicate, stretch, split - no. of plasmids in each cell is random
division time - time for one cell to replicate into two 
Gas Exchange - when gases swap via diffusion - happens with 02 and CO2 in alveoli to red blood cells
```
### B3
```
Cell --> Tissue --> Organ --> Organ system --> Organism
Organ - made up of multiple different tissues each with a specific function
Tissue - group of similar cells working together. Can be more than one type of cell. Mammals:
Muscular tissue - contracts to move attached limb/bone at joint
Glandular tissue - makes and secretes hormones & enzymes
Epithelial tissue - cover some parts of body (e.g inside of gut)
Enzyme - biological catalyst for chemical reactions in body:
- Carbohydrase - breaks down carbs --> simple sugars | Amylase (made in salivary gland, pancreas, small intestine)
    - Amylase - breaks down starch
- Proteases - converts proteins --> amino acids eg pepsin (made in stomach, pancreas, small intestine)
- Lipases - converts lipids --> glycerol and fatty acids (pancreas, small intestine)
Substrate - substance that an enzyme works on.
Active site - location on enzyme that bind with substrate - very specific to substrate
Denature - an enzyme that changes shape because of broken bonds from overheating
Optimum temperature - temperature where the enzyme is most active
Benedict's test - sugars - ranges from blue-green-yellow-red
Iodine solution - starch - browny/orange if not, blue/black is there is
Biuret test - protein - turns purple if there is
Sudan III test - lipids - top layer of bright red if there is
```
### B4
```
Double circulatory system - blood flows through heart twice in one cycle, one for deoxygenated, one for oxygenated
Vena cava - carried deoxygenated blood to heart - a vein
Heart flow - Vena cava - right atrium-(tricuspid valve)-right ventricle - pulmonary artery - pulmonary vein - left atrium-(bicuspid valve)-left ventricle - aorta 
Pacemaker - group of cells that act as pacemaker - control heart rate - found in RIGHT ATRIUM
Artificial pacemaker - controls heartbeat with an electric current for heart
Arteries - carry blood away from heart - high pressure - normal lumen - thick muscle walls, elastic fibres
Vein - carry blood toward heart - low pressure - large lumen - thinner muscle walls, elastic fibre walls - valves to keep blood flow direction
Capillary - tiny - thin, permeable walls for quick rate of diffusion. Take away waste like CO2. Arteries branch into capillaries which join up to form veins.
Red blood cell - carry oxygen around body - biconcave disk & no nucleus for surface area - contains haemoglobin that binds with oxygen
White blood cell - defend against infections, immune system - phagocytosis, antibodies, antitoxins
Platelet - small fragment of cells - stops bleeding out and microorganisms in - helps blood clot at a wound
Plasma - plae liquid which carries everything in your body around
C.H.D - Coronary heart disease - coronary arteries blocked by layers of fat(cholestrol), making lack of oxygen for heart.
Stents - tubes inserted into arteries keeping them open - effective, long-lasting, durable, surgery is quick | arteries can narrow again as scar tissue builds, blood clots can happen 
Statins - drugs reducing amount of chlorestrol in blood - reduces risk of other problems(strokes, heart attacks) - effective, used for years - must be taken regularly - risk someone forgets to take them - side effects like headaches, kidney failure, liver damage - not instant

Artificial Hearts - less likely to be rejected than donor, surgery -> bleeding and infection, parts can wear out/fail, blood clots or strokes. Patient has to take drugs aswell.
Biological valves - dont damage cells, less likely blood clots - needs replacing 10-20 yrs - may need immunosuppressant drugs - need a suitable donor so valve isnt rejected
Mechanical valves - lasts a lifetime - can lead to blood clots, patients need to take anti-cloning drugs(+side effects), valves can be loud enough to hear.
Cancer - uncontrolled cell growth & division - forms a tumour - can be benign/malignant | Risk factors: Smoking, Obesity, UV exposure, Viral infection, Genetics (inheriting faulty genes)
Benign tumour - tumour grows until no room - in one place - don't form secondary tumours - isn't dangerous or cancerous
Malignant tumour - made of cancer cells - tumour grows, spreads to neighbouring tissues - cells break off into bloodstream, invade healthy tissues - form  secondary tumours - dangerous, can be fatal - cancerous
 - Similarities: result from mutations / uncontrolled cell division // made of abnormal cells // form lump of cells
```
##### Leaves
```
Upper and lower epidermis - protective layer of cells, covered in waxy cuticle to prevent transpiration
Palisade mesophyll - underneath U.epidermis, transparent to let light reach palisade,contains chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Vertically block-shaped to fit as many as possible.
Spongy mesophyll - lots of air space for more diffusion rate, less chloroplasts in spongy cells
Stomata & guard cells - lower epidermis full of stomata, controlled by guard cells, for gas exchange of CO2 and O2 into and out of the cell for photosynthesis.
- Stomata close at night - no gas exchange = no photosynthesis.
- Trees photosynthesise(and respire) at day, and only RESPIRE at night. In dim light, rate of respiration = rate of photosynthesis = no net CO2 or oxygen change

Xylem - tube of tissue from roots to leaf, carrying water and minerals from roots. One-way process upwards
Phloem - tube of cellulose, transports water, food nutrients etc. both up and down plant, with end walls and perforations
Translocation - process that moves sugars through phloem to rest of plant - for energy
Transpiration - loss of water from plant through evaporation and diffusion on leaves. Makes more water get drawn up through xylem called transpiration stream --> Water then diffuses out of stomata --> evaporates into air.
Transpiration rate - affected by: light intensity, temperature, air flow, humidity
Potometer - method to test for transpiration rate
Adapted to photosynthesis by:
1) Broad - surface area for light capture
2) Thin - short diffuse distance in/out gases
3) Chlorophyll - allow plants to absorb light energy
4) Vessels - bring water from roots, taking glucose to plant
5) Air space - allows CO2 in, O2 out of stomata
6) Stomata - control gases leaking/water loss
Photosynthesis - affected by: 
  - Temperature - more collisions = faster reactions
  - CO2 concentration - more CO2 can be diffused into plant quicker
  - Light intensity - control stomata open/close - at night, photosynthesis stops 
    - needed to transfer energy - endothermic reaction - to start reaction of C02 and H20
```
### B5
```
Pathogen - microorganisms that enter the body and cause disease.
Communicable disease - infectious, can easily spread
Non-communicable - unable to spread.
Types of Pathogens: 1) Bacteria - very small cells, reproduce rapidly inside body, producing harmful toxins to your cells and tissues - making you feel ill. (eg salmonella, gonorrhoea)
2) Virus - really tiny, not a cell, gets inside cells and reproduces rapidly, causing cells to burst. Cell damage makes you feel ill. (e.g Measles, HIV, TMV)
3) Protists - single-celled eukaryotes, live on or inside organisms and cause them damage. Often transferred to organisms by a vector(insect immune to the disease)(eg malaria)
4) Fungi - grow and penetrate human skin, or surface of plants, causing disease.  Produce spores which spread to other living things.
Pathogens are spread by: Water, air and direct contact
Measles - spread by air - droplets from a sneeze/cough - red skin rash, fever, can be fatal
HIV - STD, or exchanging bodily fluids(blood) - controlled by anti-retrovial drugs - HIV attacks immune system, and at late stage becomes aids
TMV - Tobacco Mosaic Virus - causes a mosaic pattern on leaves, making them discoloured - slowing down rate of photosynthesis and affecting growth
Rose black spot - fungal disease - purple or black spots on leaves, making them fall off. Spreads through water and wind, can be treated with fungicides.
Malaria - protist - lives on mosquitos, from infected animals - vectors - spread by biting something else - repeated fevers, headaches, muscle pains etc - can be fatal
Salmonella - food poisoning - caused by toxins produced in intestines - can cause: fever, stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea.
Gonorrhoea - STD - pain during urination, thick yellow/green discharge from penis or vagina - treated with penicillin, however has become more resistant.
Human Defences: 
Skin - barrier to pathogens, also secretes antimicrobial substances
Hair and mucus - act as a trap to pathogens
Trachea and bronchi - covered in cilia and mucus to trap pathogens, cilia move mucus to back of throat to be swallowed
Stomach - produces HCl acid to kill pathogens
White blood cells - part of immune system - have a large nucleus, attack pathogens by phagocytosis, producing antibodies that lock onto antigens, produces antitoxins to cancel out any toxins.
Phagocytosis - process of a WBC engulfing and digesting pathogens as a line of defense - done by phagocytes
Antigens - shaped holes or stems on a pathogen that antibodies can latch onto, each pathogen's antigen shape is unique
Lymphocytes - the WBCs that produce antibodies
Semmelweis - Austria - 1840s - realised mothers treated by doctors got the disease more often than ones treated by midwives - told doctors to wash hands after operations - death rate fell 18% --> 1%
```
### B6
```
Vaccination - dead or inactive form of pathogen injected, stimulated WBCs to produce antibodies and kill it. When you are infected with the real pathogen, WBCs recognise it-with memory cells-and make adapted specific antibodies to quickly kill the pathogen and prevent you from getting disease.
 . If a higher % of population is vaccinated, disease spreads less, and can be managed. If everyone is vaccinated, the disease could die.
Painkillers - drugs that relieve pain/symptoms - don't cure disease (e.g aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen) 
Antibiotics - drugs that kill bacteria without damaging your cells, (e.g penicillin, methicillin)
 . Don't kill viruses - antibiotics attack the cell wall, but viruses live inside our cells, making it difficult to kill virus without damaging cells.
 . Bacteria can mutate and become resistant to antibiotics if over-prescribed drugs or not finishing whole course of antibiotics
4 Things to consider when making drugs:
1) Safe - no unwanted side effects
2) Effective - how good at treating the disease
3) Stable - can be stored for a long period of time and used in normal conditions
4) uptake and removal - how the body absorbs the drug, and clears it when used

3 Things to consider in a drug:
1) Efficiacy - effectiveness
2) Toxicity - is it toxic to humans?
3) Dosage - how often is it needed

Drug development stages:
1) Tested using computer models or cells in a lab
2) Tested on animals to test for side effects
3) Tested on small group of healthy humans to check its safety. Optimum dose is found.
4) Tested on small group of diseased humans.
5) Drug tested on large group of diseased patients - split into two groups - clinical double blind trials - patient and doctor dont know whether they have a placebo or not - monitor effectiveness, dosage, safety, side effects.
6) Drug ready to be prescribed.
Herd immunity - immunisation of a large proportion of a population, which reduces spread of pathogens
Placebo - inactive form of a drug, to see any psychological effects.
```

### B9 - Exercise etc
Aerobic respiration:
 - Requires oxygen
 - takes place in mitochrondria
 - Glucose breakdown fully complete - releases a lot of energy
Anaerobic:
 - no oxygen needed
 - glucose breakdown incomplete
 - Product(mammals) - lactic acid. Plant/yeast = carbon dioxide & ethanol
Organisms need energy for:
1) Proteinsynthesis
2) Digestion
3) Muscle contractions
4) Control of body temperature
5) Active transport - moving ions against concentration gradient e.g root hair cells
- respiration is exothermic as organisms feel warm to the touch
Pulse - increases when more energy(Oxy+Gl) needed by mitochrondria in muscle cells - heart beats faster, breathe faster
recovery time - time for heart rate to return to resting state
 - fitter people have shorter recovery times
Liver:
1) removes alcohol/poisonous molecules from blood
2) Breaks down old RBC, stores iron till needed to make RBCs
3) makes bile for emulsification of fats in digestion
4) removes lactic acid by convert to glucose then carbon dioxide & water
Metabolism - net result of all reactions that happen in body - anabolic(building) or catabolic(breaking down)





### B something - Yr 11 - Body responses
```
Homeostasis - regulation of internal conditions to maintain an optimal environment, in response to internal/  external changes - body temperature, blood glucose level, water levels
Negative feedback - when something gets too high/low, receptors detect the stimulus, coordination centre organises a response and effector acts to increase/decrease level - keeps on happening until not stimulated 
Central Nervous System - brain, spinal cord  - connected to the body by sensory neurons and motor neurons (in mammals) - coordinates the response from the receptor to effector
PNS - all other nerves not in CNS 
Sensory neurons - neurons that carry electrical impulses from the receptor to the CNS
Motor neurons - neurons that carry electrical impulses from the CNS to the effector
Stimuli - the change in the environment that triggers a change 
Receptor - cells that detect stimuli - one of 5 senses
Effectors - muscles or glands - respond to nervous impulses and perform an action for change
synapse - the air gap connection between two neurons - signal transferred by chemicals that diffuse across gap, set off a new signal in next neurons
Reflexes - rapid, automatic responses to stimuli that dont need conscious part of the brain - quicker as you dont need to think
Reflex arc - passage of information in a reflex (from receptor to effector) - go through spinal cord
relay neuron - neuron inside spinal cord, connects sensory to motor neuron
Practical for reaction time:
caffeine - drug that speeds up someones reaction time
1) person put their arm on edge of table, person 2 holds ruler between thumb & forefinger
2) person 2 drops ruler at random time, person 1 catches it as quick as possible
3) Record cm on ruler where its caught - repeat the test several times, calculate mean distance
4) Repeat steps 1-3 after having a caffeinated drink after 10 minutes
- Fair test - use same person, same hand, ruler dropped from same height, person 1 hasnt drank any caffeine recently

Body temperature - 37oC - optimum temp for enzymes
Body temperature - Hot: 1) Hairs lie flat 2) Sweat produced & evaporates
Body temperature - Cold: 1) Hairs stand up to trap insulating layer of air 2) Shivering - muscles contract
```
### Endocrine system
Hormones - chemical molecules released into blood - only affect particular organs (target organs) - secrected in endocrine glands - tend to have long-lasting effects
Pituitary gland - brain - produces hormones for other glands 
Thyroid - Thyroxine - regulates rate of metabolism, growth, heart rate
Adrenal gland - Adrenaline - increases oxygen & glucose to brain, muscles - 'fight or flight' response
Pancreas - Insulin & Glucagon - regulated blood glucose levels
Testes/ovaries - sperm/eggs, secrete hormones
Hormones vs nerves - nerves: very fast, short time, very precise area || Hormones: slower, long time, more general area

Eating carbohydrates - puts glucose into blood from the gut - normal metabolism removes glucose from blood
Blood glucose level - changed controlled by pancreas, in negative feedback cycle - exercise removes alot of glucose from blood
Insulin -  pancreas - glucose level high - moves glucose into cells(for respiration), excess turns to glycogen in liver
Glucagon - pancreas - glucose level low - makes glycogen turn back into glucose in liver
Glycogen - excess glucose stored in liver
Diabetes - affects cycle to control glucose level: 
  - Type 1 - pancreas produces little or no insulin - glucose level can rise to a fatal level
           - need several injections of insulin throughout day after meals
           - need to limit carbohydrates intake, take regular exercise
           - Person born with condition - genetics
  - Type 2 - person resistant to own insulin (still produce it) - glucose level can also rise to risky levels
           - overweight - increase chance of type 2 diabetes, obesity is a major risk factor
           - controlled by eating carbohydrate controlled diet, getting regular exercise

### Menstrual Cycle
Puberty - sex hormones released - trigger secondary sexual characteristics(facial hair, breasts) & cause eggs to mature in women
Ovaries (female) - produce Oestrogen - needed for menstrual cycle, controls puberty
Testicles (male) - produce Testosterone - controls puberty and sperm production
Cycle Stages:
1) - Day 1-4 - menstruation - uterus lining breaks down
2) - Day 4-14 - uterus lining builds up, into thick spongy layer full of blood vessels, ready to recieve fertilised egg
3) - Ovulation - Day 14 - Egg develops and is released
4) Day 14-28 - Wall(uterus lining) maintained - if no fertilised egg landed on wall by 28, spongy lining breaks down and cycle repeats

1) FSH(Follicle-Stimulating) - produced in pituitary gland - causes egg to mature in one ovary, in a follicle - stimulates ovaries to produce oestrogen
2) Oestrogen - produced in ovaries - causes uterus lining to grow - Simulates LH(causes release of egg), inhibits FSH
3) LH(Luteinising) - Produced in pituitary gland - Stimulates release of egg at 14 (ovulation) ^
4) Progesterone - produced in ovaries by remains of follicle - maintains uterus lining after ovulation - inhibits LH & FSH

Pregnancy - when sperm reaches ovulated egg
Oestrogen - used in contraception - if taken every day, keeps level permanently high, inhibits FSH, egg development & production stop
Progesterone - contraception - stimulates production of thick mucus - prevents sperm through

###### Methods of Contraception:
Hormonal:
1) Pill - oral - contains oestrogen & progesterone - >99% effective at preventing pregnancy, side effects: headaches, nausea - doesn't protect against STDs.
    - progesterone-only pill - fewer side effects, just as effective
2) Patch - Oe & Pr - 5x5cm patch stuck onto skin - 1 patch lasts a week
3) Implant - Pr - inserted under skin of arm - continous amount of Pr - can last for three years
4) Injection - Pr - each dose lasts 2-3 months


Non-hormonal:
1) Condoms - worn over penis - prevent sperm entering vagina - also female condoms worn inside vagina - Only contraception that protect against STDs
2) Diaphragm - shallow plastic cup over cervix - forms barrier - has to be used with spermicide
3) Spermicide - substance that disables/kills sperm - can be used alone, but only 70-80% effective
4) Sterilisation - cutting/tying fallopian tubes or sperm duct - permanent - very small chance tubes can rejoin
5) 'Natural methods' - finding out when in menstrual cycle woman is most fertile & avoiding intercourse - not very effective
6) IUD(Intrauterine device) - T-shaped - inserted into uterus to kill sperm, prevent implantation of fertilised egg. 2 types: Plastic - release Pr, Copper - prevent sperm surviving in uterus
7) Abstinence - don't have intercourse - 100% - most effective

Hormones to increase fertility - some women's levels of FSH are too low=can't get pregnant - give FSH&LH as drug to stimulate ovulation || Cons: doesnt always work, too many eggs can be stimulated - results in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets)
IVF(in-vitro fertilisation) - collects eggs from ovaries, fertilising in a lab with sperm - or ICSI - sperm injected directly into egg - useful if man has low sperm count

### Inheritance, Variation & Evolution
##### Inheritance
Heterozygous - two different alleles for characteristic (pl=heterozygote) - Bb
Homozygous - two identical alleles for characteristic (pl=homozygote) - BB, bb
Genotype - alleles present in a person for characteristic (BB, Bb, bb) - expressed as phenotype
Phenotype - physical appereance of characteristic - what you actually see 
Allele - different versions of gene, that code for a different characteristic - 2 for each characteristic
Dominant - Only 1 dominant allele needed for characteristic to show - capital letter - B
Recessive - only expressed if both alleles recessive - lowercase - b
Gamete - sex cell - egg or sperm cell
Genome - genetic code


Cystic fibrosis - excessive thick, sticky mucus in lungs & pancreas - must have 2 recessive alleles to inherit
Polydactyly - baby born with extra fingers/toes - caused by dominant allele - only 1 parent needs to have it

Genetic testing - analysis of persons DNA to see if they carry genetic disorders
Antenatal testing - analyse baby before born - offered to couples who have increased risk of producing a disordered baby - cant detect all risks of inherited disorders.
Neonatal testing - analysing a sample of blood from a baby's heel - detects disorders to treat them early
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) - used on embryos before implantation - fertility drugs stimulate release of several eggs, then collected & fertilised in Petri dish (IVF) - cells tested for disordered alleles - embryos that dont contain disorder implanted into uterus

##### Reproduction
Mitosis - asexual - diploid(zygote) cell copies itself and divides into two identical daughter cells
Meiosis - sexual - haploid(gamete) cell replicates and divides into 4 genetically different gametes
Sexual reproduction - gametes from two parents combine to produce genetically different offspring - gametes replicate meiosis. Plants & animals.
  - Variation increases chance of species surviving to changes in environment - survival advantage
  - Natural selection - organisms with good genes for that environment pass genes on successfully
  - can use selective breeding - speed up natural selection.
Fertilisation - when egg cell (mother) fuses with sperm cell (father) to form a zygote(46 chromosomes)
Zygote - fertilised cell with both egg & sperm chromosomes
Plants - reproduce sexually by pollen instead of sperm. - produce seeds
Asexual reproduction - offspring genetically identical to parent(clone). Uses Mitosis. Bacteria, some plants & animals
  - only needs one parent
  - uses less energy | faster
  - many identical offspring can be produced in favourable conditions
Asexually and Sexually reproduce:
- Malaria - reproduces sexually in mosquito, asexually when bitten into human
- Fungi - Spores - asexual spores form genetically identical fungi, sexual spores have variation, produces due to unfavourable change in environment. Natural selection 
- Plants - strawberries - 'runner' stems grow horizontally on surface, splits and forms identical 'runner' to original plant
         - bulbs(e.g daffodils) - new bulbs can form and divide off, can grow into new identical plant

##### Variation & Evolution
Environmental causes - climate, diet, accidents, culture, lifestyle
    - features - scars, accent/language, flower colour in hydrangeas
Genetic causes - every gamete contains half of genetic information needed for a person - haploid - fuses during fertilization to make a zygote/diploid containing mother and father information
Mutation - change in gene or chromosome - spontaneous, continually - always happens in DNA
Selective breeding - humans breed plants/animals for particular characteristics - select best offspring and repeat
 - Desired characteristics in plants: Disease resistance in crops | wheat with lots of grain | large/unusual flowers
 - Desired ` animals: produce lots of milk/meat | chickens that lay large eggs | domestic dogs with gentle nature
  Benefits: 
  - new varieties may be economically important - producing better/more food
  - animals selected that can't cause harm - e.g cattle without horns
  Risks: 
  - reduced variation could mean attack by specific insects/disease - would be extremely destructive
  - rare disease genes can be selected as part of positive trait - problems with specific organisms
  - create physical problems in specific organisms 
Genetic engineering - cut pieces of DNA from one organism w enzyme, join into gap in DNA of another organism
  - Uses: insect/disease resistant crops, golden rice (more Vitamin A - helps sight) || Insulin bacteria
  - Ethical issues - possible health risks 
  Benefits:
  - Faster, more efficient than selective breeding
  - Improves crop yields/quality - important in developing countries
  - Herbicide, insect, pest resistance = less herbicide used, insects eat less crops - crop not wasted
  - Sterile insects can be created - infertile offspring - reduce spread of diseases (e.g mosquitos & malaria)
  Risks:
  - not ethical to interfere with nature - GM crops more expensive - poorer people cant afford
  - harmful - toxins detected in peoples blood - can harm pollen and insects who transfer it
  - cause allergic reactions

Antibiotic resistance - bacteria reproduce at a fast rate - evolve quickly - 1) random mutation occurs 2) bacteria without mutation die or cannot reproduce with antibiotic 3) resistant bacteria reproduces with less competition from normal strains

##### Classification
King Philip Came Over For Good Soup
- Kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species#
- binomial name = genus+species
Domain - above kingdom
 - Archaea - primitive bacteria 
 - bacteria
 - eukaryota - all other - DNA in nucleus

### Ecology
organisms compete for: Food, water, energy, sunlight, mates, space
Food chain - producer --> primary(herbi/omnivore) - secondary - tertiary consumer
 - biomass transfer between organisms
apex pred - top of chain - no predators

Carbon cycle: all life carbon-based - recycled when die/decompose
 1. Carbon in atmosphere - respiration + combustion
 2. Carbon in plants by photosynthesis - animals eat plants then die - return back

Extremophile - lives in extreme environment

high biodiv - stable ecosystem
human factors: reduce biodiv - destruction of habitats.  land use, deforestation - compost - waste 

biomass pyramid - how much biomass transferred between each trophic level 
 - % absorbed = biomass of 2nd / 1st x 100
 - biomass lost as not all consumed + excretion


#### Practical - Quadrats - estimate organism population in area
1. Place 1m2 quadrat in random places in an area - count organisms
2. Calculate mean organisms per m2, multiply by total area
- to observe population density, move along a transect and record - can be affected by biotic/abiotic
3. Plot density against distance

    - Water Transport in a plant
        - First, water osmoses into the root hair cells
            - Root hair cells are cells on roots that have projections, creating a large surface area for osmosis
        - Water then goes into the root cortex cells
        - Xylem vessels then collect the water from the root cortex and transports it up the plant's stem.
        - When it reaches a leaf, water osmosis out of the xylem into the leaf's mesophyll cells.
        - So it goes, Root hair cells to Root cortex cells to Xylem vessels and Mesophyll cells in the leaf

        
    - Translocation
        - Translocation is the process by which food produced in photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to the growing regions of plants and storage organs.
        - Translocation happens through phloem tubes
            - Phloem tubes are made up of columns of elongated cells that have holes in the end walls that allow cell sap to pass between the cells
        - Translocation is bidirectional which means movement is both up and down the plant

    - Revision and Terms
        - Nucleus - The 'brain' of the cell. Every cell has a nucleus
        - Cell membrane - the outer edge of the cell that keeps the cell together. Found in plant and animal cells
        - Cell Wall - A wall around the cell and cell membrane to protect it. Only found in plant cells
        - Ribosomes - Where proteinsynthesis takes place in a plant cell, making the protein for the cell. Only found in plant cells.
        - Mitochrondria - structures in cytoplasm where aerobic respiration takes place, releasing energy for the cell. Found in plant and animal cells.

        - Diffusion - Diffusion is the process of particles travelling from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This means to diffuse is to spread out.
            - Diffusion does not require energy because it is a passive process.
            - The molecules are said to move down a concentration gradient.
        - Osmosis - Osmosis is the process of water molecules moving from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration across a partially-permeable membrane.
        - partially-permeable membrane - A wall that has tiny holes in it that are small enough to only let small molecules like water across but larger molecules cant get through. Plant and animal cells are surrounded by these.
        - Lysis - when osmosis causes animal cells to swell up and burst by too much water entering the cell.
        - Crenation - When osmosis causes concentrated solutions, which have a low concentration, to lose water and shrink.
        - Isotonic - When the concentration outside a cell is the same as the concentration inside a cell.
        - Hypertonic - When the concentration inside the cell is higher than the concentration outside the cell
        - Hypotonic - When the concentration inside the cell is lower than the concentration outside the cell. (The opposite of hypertonic)
        - Plasmolysis - this is when the cell shrinks and the cell membrane, vacuole and nucleus push away from the cell wall due to osmosis.
        - Active Transport
- Terms
    - Nucleus - The brain of the cell
    - Cell membrane - the edge of the cell needed to keep the cell in shape
    - Cell Wall - This is a protective wall around the cell.
    - Chloroplasts - This is where photosynthesis takes place in a plant cell
    - Mitochrondria - structures in the cell where aerobic respiration takes place, releasing energy for the cell
    - Ribosomes - where proteinsynthesis takes place making all the proteins for the cell.
    - Diffusion - when particles travel from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration to spread out in the air. They are said to move down a concentration gradient.
        - Diffusion is a passive process - no energy is needed
    - Osmosis - when water molecules travel from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration solution across a partially permeable membrane
        - Osmosis requires energy
    - partially-permeable membrane - A sort of wall membrane with tiny holes in it that can only let small molecules like water get through but not bigger molecules.
    - Isotonic - when the concentration outside the cell is equal to the concentration inside the cell
    - Hypertonic - when a solution has a higher concentration than the concentration outside the solution(cell).
    - Hypotonic - When a solution has a lower concentration than the concentration outside the solution(cell) - basically the opposite of hypertonic
    - Plasmolysis - when the cell shrinks and the vacuole and cell membrane pull away from the cell wall.
    - Active transport - when particles travel from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. Basically the opposite of diffusion. Active transport works by absorbing particles outside the cell (low concentration) to inside the cell where there is a high concentration. An example is when the roots in a plant absorb minerals from the ground.

        - They move in a sweeping motion to trap microbes from the air in mucus.
            - When the microbes are trapped in mucus, the cilia move them up to the mouth so they can be swallowed.
        - Smokers can develop a smokers cough.
            - This is when the cilia are destroyed and so the mucus can not be swept up to the mouth and hence they have a constant cough to try and remove the mucus.

        - Dead or inactive form of the pathogen injected
        - Antigens stimulate WBCs to produce antibodies
        - The white blood cells have memory cells, which remember and can recognise the pathogen if it comes again.
        - If you are infected with that disease, WBCs recognise the disease, adapt and quickly kill it, stopping you from getting infected.
        - If a higher % of the population is vaccinated the disease spreads way less, there are less cases and it is easier to manage. If everyone gets vaccinated it is possible the disease will eventually die.
    - Medical Drug development

            - Stable (can be stored for long periods and used in normal conditions)
            - Uptake and removal (The body absorbs the drug, and clears it when its used)
        - When making a new drug, consider:
            - Efficiacy (how effective it is)
            - Toxicity (Is the drug toxic to humans?)
            - Dosage (How often its needed)
        - Order in how medical drugs are made
            1. Drug tested using computer models and cells grown in a lab
            2. Drug is tested on animals ( worms, fruit flies, mice) to study any side effects
            3. Drug tested on small number of volunteer patients who have the illness, to ensure it works
            4. Drug tested on small group of healthy human volunteers to check its safety
            5. Drug tested on large group of volunteers to monitor drug effectiveness, safety, dosage and side effects
            6. Drug approved and can be prescribed
    - Placebo - a drug with nothing in it, but the patient thinks there is something in it.
    - Double blind trial - when the doctor nor the patient knows who has been given the drug or the placebo.
- B7 - Non-communicable diseases
