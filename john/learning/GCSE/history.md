## COLD WAR
Grand alliance - 1941 - Soviet union, USA and Britain - joined to win and end the war
Tehran conference - 1943 - D-day - USA, Britain invade France on second front in 1944, USSR join war after Nazis defeated
 - A UN organisation agreed set up after war
 - Area of eastern Poland added to SU - buffer between germany
- Consequence: shows how allies cooperating, Roosevelt believed could negotiate w Stalin, accepted some Soviet control in Europ
  - However, tensions = Churchill mistrustful, hating communism
Yalta - Feb 1945 - Agreed to: 
1) split Germany into 4 zones(France, Britain, USA, USSR each a zone)
2) force Germany to pay reparations
3) set up the United Nations
4) Free elections in eastern european countries liberated from Nazi control
Consequence: shows how allies still cooperating - united by common enemy, Stalin happy
- disagreements over Germany reparations + Poland|German border  - clear agreements on eastern europe would be difficult.
Potsdam - July 1945 - Agreed to:
   1) Divide Germany and Berlin into 4 zones
   2) Let the power in each zone take reparations in kind from its zone
   - Truman & Churchill concerned Stalin wasnt going to allow free elections as agreed in Yalta - Stalin arrested 16 non-communist polish leaders - Poland pro-communist
  - Stalin insisted double reparations to compensate for losses during war, but West refused - wanted Germany to recover
Capitalism - ideal-everyone free to invest money to own land, businesses and property. Can keep any profits they make - democracy - hierarchy
Communism - ideal-all land, businesses owned by state and profits made used for good of all. No individual profit-making - Elections from same party, all citizens equal.
Long Telegram - 1946 - George Kennan - Soviet Union heavily armed, wanted to destroy capitalism. USSR threat to world peace, USA needed strong action
Novikov telegram - 1946 - Nikolai Novikov - USA wanted to take over world, even if they had to go to war with USSR to destroy communism.
Satellite state - countries controlled or under the influence of USSR - many people unhappy in these countries but faced oppression if objected.
Iron curtain - 'metaphor' - border between pro-capitalist European countries in West and pro-communist countries in the East.
#### Soviet takeovers 1945-48
Why: Stalin wanted security 
   - Germany attacked twice - 25m Soviets dead in WW2 - wanted a buffer of friendly countries 
   - helped communists seize power in E.Europe
How: SALAMI TACTICS - Red Army(Soviet) soldiers in charge of E.europe after pushing Nazis out of places 
   - arrested opponents - leader of Small Holders Party - Hungary, rigged elections - Romania won 70%, 16 non-communist Poles arrested
Consequence: Soviets more secure - 'buffer zone' between West
   - forces US 'containment' policy - Truman Doctrine, Marshall plan 
   - Soviets respond with Cominform & Comecon - Cold war rivalry & division deepens.

Truman Doctrine - 1947 - promised aid to any country threatened by communism - Greece & Turkey $400m - increased tension, rivalry deepened
Marshall Plan - 1947 - George Marshall advised - $12bn in aid to European countries - recover economy after war - won 16 countries over to capitalism - trade w USA increases
Cominform - 1947 - USSR direct response to Marshall plan - put all European communist parties under their control, attempt to create trade network, prevent trading with West. Any communists with different views pushed out of parties. Published newspaper - ideals
Comecon - 1949 - centralise planning of industry & agriculture in East - promised financial aid - keep countries loyal (Molotov plan) - called Marshall plan 'Dollar Imperialism', banned countries(It+Fr) from accepting Marshall aid - encouraged trade and specialise in certain areas: Hungary=food, E.Germany=industry(coal and steel)

Trizonia - 1948 - USA, Britain, France
Berlin blockade - June 1948 - W.Berlin was capitalist advert in communist area - Stalin blocked all land routes to Berlin for Trizonia, hoping withdrawal from West Berlin - led to NATO & Warsaw Pact - CW tension greatly increased
  - Consequences: Negotiations of agreed future of Germany gone, Germany divided-East&West
  - NATO created to prevent soviet expansions - heightened tensions - shows wasr between USA and USSR was distinct possibility - Led to Warsaw Pact 1955
Berlin airlift - Trizonia flew supplies to W.Berlin 4000 tonnes a day, lasted for 11 months, cost $224m. On May 1949 - land blockade lifted
Warsaw Pact - 1955 - Response to W.Germany joining NATO - 8 countries - Soviet generals in charge of each country. Consequence: Greater Soviet control - pact troops used in Hungary&Czeckslovakia crisis

#### Arms race 1945-60
1949-53 - US increased military spending by $30bn \\ USSR by $10bn.
1945 - USA - atomic bomb - Hiroshima,Nagisaki \\ USSR - 1949 - atomic bomb
1952 - USA - first hydrogen bomb - 1000x powerful \\ 1953 - USSR tests own H bomb
1957 - USSR - first ICBM \\ 1959 - USA - submarines capable of launching nuclear weapons at coast of USSR
1961 - USSR - Tsar Bomb - most powerful H bomb ever created.
1968 - USA - missile that can hit multiple targets \\ USSR - technology to shoot down incoming missiles 

#### Hungarian Uprising 1956
Why: - Khrushchev 'Secret speech' - criticise Stalin - raised hope for change
- Poland & Austria given more freedom, less soviet control - Hungarians inspired
- Rakosi - hardline Stalinist - brutal secret police, 2,000 killed, 200,000 imprisoned since 1947
  - Living standards fell - Fuel, food shortages - Hungarians began to protest - 'uprising' began
What: October - Khr. sent in tanks to stop protests/restore order - 12 killed, hundreds wounded
- Former PM Imre Nagy returned - more popular - tanks withdrawn
- Nagy - announced reforms = free press, speech, elections - then said Hungary would leave Warsaw Pact
- Khr. under pressure to act from other communist countries 
    - 200,000 troops, 6,000 tanks - 3,000 killed & 200,000 refugees fled - Nagy sent to Romania, executed
Consequence: 1) Strengthened control & Khr. power. Clear Warning to all satellite states to not try anything
2) USA - saw this as confirming aggressive & brutal nature of communism. Khr. shown how brutal he could be - crushed hopes of a 'thaw' in relations
3) Britain - took 20,000 refugees. Time magazine named Hungary freedom fighter 'Man of the Year' - CW rivalry deepened - both sides saw the worst of each other

#### Berlin Crisis 1958-63 | Berlin Wall & Summits
Why:
  - Khr. calls W.Berlin a 'fishbone stuck in our throat'
  - 100,000 refugees fled from East Germany through W.Berlin 1955-60
  - ‘Brain drain’ - East Germany lost 3m(15-20%) of population - engineers, teachers, professors
  - Khr. embarrassed - worried W.Germany stronger, E.Germany weaker - issues 6 month ultimatum
What: 4 Summits:
  1) Geneva - Khrushchev & Eisenhower - no agreement, reduces tensions, Khrushchev visits USA
  2) USA - Camp David - Kh. in USA demonstrates better relations - no deal, agree to meet again in Paris - Khr. removes 6 month ultimatum
  3) Paris - 1960 - U2 spy plane shot down over Soviet territory - 2 weeks prior. Eisen refuses to apologise - Khr. furious & storms out - Failure, tensions rose
  4) Vienna - 1961 - Khr. reissues 6 month ultimatum - new President JFK takes tough line - after embarrassment of Bay of Pigs, fear of behind Soviets in space race - JFK rejects ultimatum - $3.5b increase on defence spending
Consequences:
  - Berlin Wall - Aug 1961 - Khr. starts barbed wire fence and wall - division solid - Checkpoint Charlie tensions - tanks face off, backchannels used - Soviets back tanks away then US - 170 died 1961-89 trying to cross
  - JFK visits W.berlin - Berlin wall symbol of division in world - propaganda success for West
  - stabilised relations - berlin less source of tension
  - stopped refugee crisis - stabilised E.Germany - JFK 'a wall is better than a war'

#### Cuba Crisis & Cuba missile crisis
1959 - Castro overthrows Batista - US worried - Castro took control of US businesses in cuba - USA banned sugar imports to cuba - 90% of their trade - USSR offered help - sent economic, military, technical aid - Khr. wanted ally close to USA
Bay of Pigs - 1961 - CIA trained cuban exiles - sent 1,400 to invade cuba - massive failure - within two days, 1,100 exiles captured & ransomed to USA in exchange for $53m of food, medicine.
  - made Kennedy look weak & indecisive - strengthened USAs belief in need for containment
  - USSR & Cuba developed closer ties - USSR gave military suppport to Cuba to threaten USA

Cuban Missile Crisis:
- Khr. building missile base in Cuba to: protect Cuba, retaliate against US missiles in Turkey pointed at USSR, show his strength to rest of world - US found out on 16th October 1962 - he wanted to act but didnt want to start world war.
- '13 Days' on brink of nuclear war: 16-21 Oct - JFK set up ExComm to discuss action - wanted to appear strong - placed a naval blockade around Cuba to prevent Soviet ships docking - 18 SU ships turned around
  - 22nd: JFK made televised address to US about missiles in Cuba & blockade
  - 23-24: Khr. told Kennedy his ships would break through blockade - soviet ships turned back at blockade
  - 25th: US spy planes reported increased building work at missile site in Cuba
  - 26th: Kennedy recieves telegram - Khr. promised to remove launch sites if USA didnt invade Cuba
  - 27th: second telegram - launch sites removed only if turkey missiles removed - JFK couldn't openly agree as NATO allies would object - said he wouldn't invade Cuba - secretly agreed to remove missiles in turkey. 28th: Khr. removes Cuba missiles
Consequences: Kennedy - showed he was a strong leader who prevented USSR from delivering warheads to Cuba
- Khrushchev - saved Cuba from American invasion - protected communism - forced USA to remove Turkey missiles
- Hotline - direct line between White House & Kremlin - leaders could talk immediately - leaders aware of how close they were to war & prepared to co-operate to avoid it again - relaxed tensions 
- hotline - led to Test Ban Treaty, Non-proliferation treaty & Detente

#### Czechslovakian crisis
Why: New communist leader - Dubcek - replaced hard-line Novotny - made reforms to economic problems aka 'Prague Spring':
- protests, freedom of speech, reduce secret police powers, 10 yr plan to move to multi-party democracy
What: Brezhnev worried - had strong industry, key 700km buffer zone + vital Warsaw pact member - E.German & Polish also feared reforms
 - 200,000 Soviet,(Bulgarian, Hungarian, E.german, Polish) troops - no armed resistance - <100 killed, Dubcek replaced
Consequence: Brezhnev doctrine - made clear SU would use force if communist control was threatened in E.Europe
 - China angry - US protested but no action - limited impact of relations.

#### Detente - attempt to relax/improve relations (Nixon & Brezhnev)
Both sides wanted to reduce cost of arms race - shocked by Cuban crisis closeness to war - US wanted S.U influence, S.U wanted US technology 
    - 1968 - Non-proliferation treaty - stop spread of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear countries - 5 Countries were USA,UK,USSR,China, France
    - 1972 - SALT 1 - 5 yr freeze on ICBMs - limits on Anti-ballistic missile systems
    - 1975 - Helsinki agreement - 35 countries -  officially agreed post-war borders of Europe - S.U acceptance of W.Germany - reduces tensions, agreed respecting human rights, encouraged trade

#### Afghanistan
1979 - SU sent 50,000 troops to support Afghan communist party PDPA
Carter doctrine - promise aid to neighbours and military action if Persian gulf interests threatened
- Grain shipments stopped, CIA aid to mujahedeen guerrillas
- 5% defense spending increase - Reagan promises $1 trillion on arms race
- Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan important - ended Detente, created new arms race

### Reagan
January 1981 - Reagan
- Second CW - 1983 - ending Detente by creating SDI('Star Wars') - planned space-based anti-missile system 
- Reagan promises $1 trillion on arms race
- 20 Missiles in Western SU - called SU 'evil empire'
- 6 Trident nuclear subs + Neutron bomb developments - increased tensions

### Gorbachev
1985 - reforms to improve relations & stop arms race
- Didn't get involved with E.europe on fighting against communism - encouraged it
Issues in USSR:
 - Afghanistan war
 - Chernobyl - power plant incident
 - Discontentment in Eastern Bloc
#### New thinking
Glasnost - relaxed censorship
Perestroika - restructuring of economy - reduce military spending, Sov. businesses trade with West -  led to open criticism within SU, weakened control
Summits - attempt to end arms race:
- Geneva 1985 - committed to speed up arms talks  - led to INF treaty
- INF treaty - 1987 - both agree to scrap Intermediate nuclear weapons - 2600 destroyed
Abandoned Brezhnev doctrine - communists can do things their way 
 - withdrew
Dec 1988 - reduced troops to 50k in E.europe
- Poland, Hungary, Romania & Czech held free multi-party elections

Consequences of new thinking:
- weakened Soviet control, people question communism = protests, demands for change + collapse of SU
- Abandoned Brezhnev doctrine

E. Germans demanded change - Gorb didnt get involved - rulers allowed freedom of travel - Berlin Wall collapsed - Nov 9th 
  - mark of end of Cold War
  - 1990 Germany united
### Collapse of SU/ Official End of CW
1990 - 14 Baltic states Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia declared independance - others(5 'stans (Turkmenistan.etc)) demanded it
Warsaw Pact - ended officially July 1991
Gorbachev - officially announced end of Soviet Union/resigned - Christmas day 1991 (25th Dec)

2 Consequences:
1. countries gained independance
2. Warsaw Pact ended



### int
It is quite useful to an enquiry into the consequence of Reagen's presidency for the Cold war as it helps us learn that Reagan was heavily against USSR and increased tensions. For example it says 'he used insulting and provocative language against the USSR.' What the source shows is useful because there is evidence to support this. For example I know that he described the Soviet Union as the 'evil empire', and made a Star Wars(SDI) program in 1983 to develop and anti missile system in space - increased budget by a trillion dollars.

It is quite useful to an enquiry into the consequence of Reagen's presidency for the Cold war as it helps us learn that Reagan led to a 'Second Cold War'. For example, it says 'A new arms race began. Spending and weaponry increased impressively.' What the source shows is useful because there is evidence to support it. For example I know that there was a $1 trillion defence spending programme 1981-7, and a 'Star Wars' defence programme in 1983 to develop an anti-missile system in space. This is useful to an enquiry as it shows how tensions were heavily increased and Reagan was risking all out war.


Sat History lesson:
I partially agree with Interpretation 2  as it says the fear of Germany and the opportunity to create a buffer zone were the most important features in the Soviet takeovers. I agree as I know that Stalin wanted a 'sphere of influence' around the Soviet Union, after being attacked twice in a generation by Germany. So clearly this evidence supports Interpretation 2 that the key features were defensive and opportunistic because Russia wanted more security..

Interpretation 1 challenges Interpretation 2. It suggests that how the Soviet takeovers took place was the key feature, with rigged elections, arrests and assassinations. I agree as I know that in 1945, 16 non-communist polish leaders were arrested. Soviets also rigged elections like in Romania where communists won 70% of the vote. So clearly this evidence supports Interpretation 1 that the key feature of the Soviet takeovers was the negative consequences because it contributed to the Cold War rivalry and division of Europe.

Huguenots - persecution - protestants fled persecution from France after St Bartholomew's day massacre, banning of their shops and tolerance - French King ended 'Edict Of Nantes' - 1685 - 50,000 settled in England
Huguenots - government - Charles II - letters of Denization | 1681 | allowed Huguenots to gain type of citizenship
Jews - persecution - 30,000 killed in Ukraine - England tolerated them - Flemish & Walloons too
Jews - government - Cromwell & Charles II - allowed Jews to return
Flemish & Walloons - Sandwich and Canterbury invited to help settle economies
British Empire beginning - growing trade - African and Asian sailors (Lascars), & Asian nannies (Ayahs) - East India Company growing - by 1700, 15000 or more
Creation of East India Company & Charles' charter allowing Company of Royal adventures - W.Africa trade - sailors & slaves
African sailors - John Blanke - Trumpeter for Henry VIII || Jaques Francis - diver
12,000 Palatines fleeing poor harvests - hope to go to Carolinas + some fleeing religious persecution
Dutch - invites as labourers - drain 40,000 acres of Fenlands
#### EXPERIENCE
##### Positives
Huguenots - 50,000 settled, welcomed - highly skilled eg silk weavers - successful | Bank of England founders huguenot - 1709: Naturalisation Act - 2k benefited | Employed 50,000 in London - silk production 20x
Walloons, Canterbury - set up 800 looms - nee cloth dyeing skills - given 100 houses - about 20,000 Flemish & Walloons settle so lots of community support
Jews - allowed to return by Cromwell - allowed own synagogue set up in 1701 - Religious freedom
##### Negatives
Roman gypsies - persecuted - 1601 vagrancy laws - many were hung, others enslaved and sent to Caribbean. 
African & Asian - some held respected positions - John Blanke - Henry 8th trumpeter, Jacques Francis - expert diver and court witness = respect
- Fashion for aristocrats to have African & Asian children as servants - Lascars settled in ports(Liverpool) did hard dock work - some Ayahs abandoned when here
Black community - 15000 - Lascars only 1000 so quite small, less community support
'Evil May Day' riots - 1,000 strong mob attacked 'strangers' - 0 killed - 300 rioters executed
Jews - anti-semitism persisted - still banned from being lawyers, going to Uni, serving in army or parliament
#### IMPACT
Government - Elizabeth I issued charter to set up East India Company - trade in cotton, silk & spices - grows
Government - 1660 - Charles II issued charter to set up Royal Adventures trading to Africa - transatlantic slave trade grows - huge wealth brought into country - sugar trade growth especially.
Economic: - Flemish & Walloons - 1500s - help Canterbury grow, 1,000 looms, employ 1000s
Huguenots - train 500 apprentices - new techniques like brocade and taffeta - fashion industry grows
Huguenots - 10% of funds to set up Bank Of England - helped set up Sheffield Steel Industry
### c1700-1900
#### WHY
Persecution & religion refugees - 1880s - Pogroms in Russia, 100,000 Jews came to more tolerant Britain. Had political refugees - Karl Max

I strongly agree with Interpretation 2 that religious persecution drove migration, as the source says "French protestants in the early modern(1500-1700) to Jewish migrants in the 1800s." I agree as I know that groups like the Huguenots moved to Britain after Louis tore up the 'Edict of Nantes', removing their religious freedom. Over 50,000 settled, fleeing from religious persecution. Jewish migrants fleeing religious persecution came due to England being very tolerant like when Cromwell ruled the 1290 expulsion didnt apply, and between 19th-20th century 100,000 Jews fled Russian pograms, and Nazis in 1930s. So clearly this evidence supports interpretation 2 that religion was a key cause of migration because it shows how all over Europe, religious groups were persecuted.
### Notting Hill
#### WHY
Paddington - first Caribbean carrying London station - near Notting Hill - officials meet migrants & find place to stay
- Friends & relatives - Caribbean markets, cafes, restaurants set up - attraction
- Notting Hill - had places to rent, hard to find people to rent them - 'slum housing' - 90% Landlords objected Black renters
Portobello road - market developed many Caribbean food outlet, music venues & shops spread - Island records 1969
#### Housing
- bombed, damaged houses - very cheap - landlords struggle to rent - charged 2-3x more than white renters - share rent=overcrowding - 4-5 per room
- HMOs - Houses of Multiple Occupancy - single house rented to several people, kitched & bathroom shared, bedrooms=2-3 each - overcrowded, poor living conditions
- No rent laws - landlords charged what wanted, could throw out caribbeans at any time - white tenants contol rent charged+evictions, called 'Statutory tenancy' - til Rent Act 1965 
  - Peter rachman - 'slum landlord' - owned 100 NH properties
Efforts to improve:
NHHT - NH housing trust - raised funds, provide quality more affordable housing - 5 sold in 1st year --> 1000 by 1970
Pardner Scheme - Sam King - allowed migrants to afford deposit to buy a house - no rely on landlords
#### Impact of Cultures
Shops, markets, pubs, cafes/restaurants - All Saints & portobello road - spices & seasoning - colour bars stopped black people entering
    - The Apollo - 
- Black businesses - 1959 - Frank Circhlow - 'El Rio' - popular restaurant
#### Black activism
## Anglo-Saxons England 1060-66
### Society & Government
2 features Social system:
Feature 1: Hierarchical - clear order of status - Kings, Earls, Thegns(local lords), Ceorls, peasants, slaves
Feature 2: Rural - 90% of 2m made living from farming
Feature 3: Social status could change/not fixed - Peasants --> Thegns if get 5 hides of land
Towns:
1. burhs - main anglo-saxon towns - fortified with strong walls - protected from Viking raiders attack
2. Important for trade - all trade worth a certain amount had to be in towns by law, so it can be taxed
- international links: Norwich - herring trade, York - w Denmark - about 100 towns
Saxon Economy:
1. Centered on towns - weekly markets, Craftsmen trade hand-made goods, towns(York) had streets named after trades (cobblers, bakers)
    - towns with mints made silver coins overseen by royal official
2. Wealthy & developed - farming well organised - 6000 mills grinding grain to flour

Kings Powers include:
- making new laws - sheriffs
- controlling minting & circulation of new coins 
- Taxes - decide geld tax - used to defend against Vikings
- Executing God's will on earth
- Giving/taking away land
- raising fleet and army (fyrd)
Witan - King's council - 1.made important decisions like selecting monarch | 2.gave advice to monarch on rebels etc | no fixed meeting place for Witan, monarch decided where
Wergild - money paid to end/avoid blood feuding
Shire reeve (Sheriffs) - collected fines like Wergild / King's representative in local government - King gave orders through 'writs'
Shires - military role | responsible for supplies men for Fyrd - for every 5 hides of land, 1 man was always available
Thegns - Local lords
Ceorl - free peasants
Population 10% slaves, 90% lived on countryside
1060 - 90% lived in villages
3 reasons Earls had so much power:
1. Political & Legal - acted as governors & administrators - responsible for law and order in area | judges in local courts, more wealth & authority, vital to run country
   - advised King on rebellions/invasions, sometimes sent on diplomatic missions
2. Economic - collected taxed, could keep 1/3 - very rich & powerful - used tax to ensure earldom defended - some even wealthier than King
3. Military - military men, expected to fight alongside King - had elite bodyguard of housecarls - military leaders against enemies (eg. Tostig & Harold crushing rebellions in Wales)

Trial system - courts sometimes couldn't make decision - trial by ordeal (hold hot iron, if heal=not guilty, if infected=guilty)
 - each shire had a shire court - Jury of 12 would make judgement, fines collected by sheriffs and given to King

#### The Godwinsons
1. Most powerful family in England due to ownership of land
    - Harold - Earl of Wessex, wealthiest Earldom in England - income: 8500 vs King at 6000 - richer than King
    - H's brother - Earl. East Anglia, half-brother Tostig = Earl. Northumbria 
    - had significant power - many thegns under their control(pay taxes) - only earldom not under godwinsons was Mercia.
2. Important marriage alliances - more power
    - H's sister married to King Edward
    - Harold had unofficial marriage to Edith - powerful landowner in East Anglia, sister of Morcar & Edwin, earls of Northumbria & Mercia - gave him support from E.Anglia and North
3. great military might - feature of Harold's claim to throne
    - dealt with Wales rebellions 1055-63 - military success won him supporters - many thegns supported him & rewarded for loyalty
  - 1065 - Uprising against Tostig - harold backed Morcar, not Tostig - Harold gained support of one more earldom
#### Embassy to Normandy
1. shows Harold was King's trusted political, military advisor 
2. Harold's ship blown off course, landed in territory of Guy of Ponthieu & taken prisoner
    - William demanded his release, Harold joined William fighting local enemies - W. rewards him with a suit of chainmail, weapons & helmet
3. used by Normans to boost William's claim to throne
    - Harold swore oath over box of saints bones that he would recognise William as next King - said he was 'oath breaker' - shows importance of oaths in ang-sxn times
#### Uprising against Tostig 1065
1. unfair taxes - Tostig increased them too much - many thegns/peasants angry - not using geld tax for right purpose - northen Danelaw not used to heavy taxes like South
2. unjust laws & mistreatment of nobles - imposed strict new laws, reduced banditry BUT accused many innocent of banditry.
    - Tostig accused of murder of several members of leading Northumbrian families - 1064 - he assassinated Gamal when visited him under safe conduct. Gospatric, son of N. earls assassinated, some blamed Tostig - thegns angry as he falsely accused people of crimes in order to take money/lands from them.
3. his friendship with Malcolm III, Scotland King - meant he wouldn't defend Northumbria from scottish attacks - Tostig was away in 1061, Malcolm invaded & Tostig didn't retaliate, agreed peace terms
    - people supported Morcar over him
Consequences:
1. Edwards orders ignored, Tostig exiled & replaced by Morcar - Edward wanted earls to crush rebellion, however Harold agreed with rebels to replace Tostig as Morcar would better protect from Viking attack - Tostig exiled-furious
2. Harold won support of Northumbria & Mercia - he needed a united kingdom to fight threats from Norway, Normandy, Scotland after Edward died
3. Strengthened Harold's claim to throne - Witan more likely to accept him, all powerful earls on his side
4. Led to 1066 battle - Tostig partnered with Harald Hardrada|Norway - backed Hardrada in claim for throne

#### Succession crisis
Edward: most at fault - failed to publicly name an heir - opened door to multiple competing claims
Harold G: strong claim - Edward entrusted Kingdom to him on his death bed - Witan quickly approved and was crowned King - also Earl of wessex, great wealth + military might + many loyal thegns, housecarls - proved leadership in Welsh rebellion
William - distant cousin of Ed, claimed promised throne in 1051 + showed harold's embassy, oath & accepting arms to conform him as next King - Pope backed claim - gave him Papal banner, with religious support, claim was strong
Hardrada: support of Tostig + 10,000 men claimed a promise from previous King (Cnut) to previous King of Norway. (+) When Tostig exiled, convinced Norwegian King to assert his claim to throne
Edgar Atheling: great-nephew of Ed - only 12

Harold G's reign:
1. Chosen by Witan - had support of most of England
2. Crowned day after Ed died - didn't want others claiming the throne
Fulford Gate:
1. Sept 1066 - Hardrada + Tostig, 10,000 men - Edwin & Morcar battled, lost 750 men
2. armies of Mercia & Northumbria were battered - Hardrada took hostages & waited outside York for local leaders
Stamford bridge:
- Harold raced 190 miles in 5 days - suprise attacked H & T - Vikings not even wearing chainmail + exhausted + lost 1,000 men - Harold's army increased in size as he marched from London, giving him superior numbers
- Consequences:
- Out of 300, 25 Viking ships returned to Norway - H & T were killed
- Godwinson had lost 5000+ men, including his housecarls(best fighters) - weakened him heavily
- As he celebrated news arrived that W had arrived at Pevensey Bay - unopposed - Harold raced 300km South

#### Invasion - Hastings
Why William won:
1. his ability to be flexible - tactics like feigned retreat - when direct calvary charges failed, Normans pretended to flee back, Saxon chased them and were surrounded. Harolds general fyrd was not trained or disciplined - this broke their Shield wall
    - W's knights crucial to this plan, horsemen could cut off Saxons easily. Knights also could cut in the gaps of Shield wall. Will had 2,000 Knights, and Harold had 0.
2. W's leadership and organisation skills - organised 7000 forces & 700 ships, fed & disciplined them Aug-Sept, organising 13 tonnes of hay a day.
    - When W landed he circled around London, plundering villages, provoking Harold to fight rather than rest/recover
3. Stamford bridge weakened Harold massively - had to race 400 miles within 1 month, and had lost 5000+ men. Harold had to march 2 days after Stamford.
4. Harold's mistakes - rushing to William unprepared. William had Knights and Harold didnt
## Willliam I - securing the Kingdom
#### Securing control
1. Terrorise, seize treasure, Edgar submits - Witan met after H's death and crowned Edgar King. Will took route around West&northern edge of London, burning villages as he went - force Edgar to submit - sent soldiers to seize Royal treasury at Winchester, so Edgar lacked funds to reward his followers.
    - At Berkhamstead, Edgar submitted to William, hostages handed over, oaths made - Will crowned King on Christmas day 1066.
2. Kept English nobles happy - W had 10,000 men, for oaths of loyalty he allowed key earls(Edwin & Morcar) to keep positions.
    - Head of church, Archbishop Stigand allowed to keep position
    - Thegns who didn't fight at Hastings could buy their land from Wil
3. Reward followers to help rule+show power - raised a tax to pay mercenaries, sent rich gifts to Pope, family+close advisors got large areas of land. Half-brother Odo got all of Kent, right-hand man William FitzOzbern got Isle of Wight, Hampshire
#### Marcher earldoms
1. 3 Marcher earldoms to reward followers, retain loyalty:
- Chester - next to North Wales - Hugh 'the fat' - father supplied 60 ships for Wil's invasion
- Shrewsbury - next mid Wales - Roger - in charge of Normandy when W invading England
- Hereford - South Wales - William FitzOzbern - right-hand man
All had supplies, knights. Wil gained loyalty as someone who rewarded followers - helped keep control
- marcher earldoms given special privileges - no taxes, build castles & towns & markets, control law&order themselves.
  - could also get wealthier
2. Helped secure borders with Wales - castles could be built quickly to defend & bases to raid wales. Marcher earls could respond quickly and forcefully to trouble without King - keep control
3. Could create boroughs with markets & churches - helped attract Normans to areas + trade(wealth for Earl) - helped colonise Wales border. They had to pay for castles & supply feudal knights - helped Wil financially
- from rewarding followers, securing loyalty, securing Welsh border - helped William
#### Revolt of Edwin & Morcar
- Wil marched to York, harrying areas as he went. Strong show of force led to E&M's surrender before fighting. Robert new earl
Why: 
1. Loss of land - Wil reduced size of Morcar(Northumbria) & Edwin(Mercia) earldoms - loss of power and money
    - Many thegns lost land, so E&M had support to revolt - anglos angry
2. Bad government by Odo and Wil FitzOsbern - Odo seized ang-sx lands illegally, soldiers attacked women unprovoked
3. Castles - constant reminder of Norman control - angs angry - York, Dover - dominated area, homes often destroyed (300 to build 2 in York) - english forced to provide labour to build castles
    - castellan - person in charge of castle - can force locals to provide for castle(food, materials) - more anger
4. Geld tax - 1066 - greedy - Wil raised heavy geld tax, used to reward his followers & taken to Normandy - angered Anglos as their money used for enriching Normans in normandy, not for defense.
#### Harrying of the North (HOTN)
Why:
1. North's connection to Danes - large Danish population = England vulnerable to invasion - 1069 Edgar Atheling joined w Danes, King came with 240 ships in rebellion. Most significant threat - Wil able to stop threat, but connection to Danes was too much of threat - obliterated threat with total destruction in North - HOTN - ensure no future invasion, as knew Vikings were plotting
2. Avenge death of northumbrian earl Robert + 900 men in 1069 - Robert taken large force north (Jan 1069), slaughtered by Northumbrians, Robert burned to death - Robert was a newly-appointed earl for Wil
    - HOTN cost Wil economically as North was wasteland - 1000s starved to death w no crops - main reason was Danish invasion
3. Frequency of rebellions - 3 rebellions in 1069 - needed to stop, HOTN sent brutal message with villages destroyed Durham to York + 100,000 dead - Danish was only geniune threat to his reign and HOTN was his only option 
#### Hereward the Wake 1070
Why:
Hereward - thegn from East Anglia, exiled by Edward - returned with his lands as Normans - brother killed day before - killed all Normans in his house.
    - With Danish support, attacked Peterborough Abbey, took treasure. Hid at Ely, Morcar and others rallied to support him.
What: Williams response
1. Wil bribed Danes to divide Hereward - took some of treasure and left - Wil could then find a way into Ely - made bridge across marshes with boats
2. These rebels were brutally punished with mutilation - Morcar imprisoned in Normandy, Edwin fled to Scotland but betrayed, handed over & killed
3. Hereward escaped - made peace with wil - won return of his lands for homage to Wil - shows uprising wasn't about overthrowing Normans - last major saxon rebellion

- 1072-87 - Wil only spent 20% of time in England - shows his power was secure 

### Revolt of Earls 1075
Why:
1. Roger angry - lost land & power - marcher earldom Hereford reduced - when father(FitzOsbern) died he reduced size -meant loss of power & wealth 
   - Wil also introduced own sheriffs - loss of authority || + said no to sister(Emma) marrying Ralph, but did anyway
2. Ralph - same reason - land & power, father died - only had parts of East Anglia & Norfolk - marriage w Emma led to alliance
3. Waltheof - wanted more land - at wedding told plans to revolt
- revolt by all 3 would be catastrophic - lands stretched east-west, north-midlands - William was in Normandy - Archbishop Lanfranc left in charge
What - failed:
- both rebels didnt get as much support as expected
1. Waltheof told Lanfranc about revolt - arranged armies to stop Ralph & Roger joining - they failed to change plan to meet in North - Lanfranc also used religious authority to excommunicate Roger, reducing his support
2. Roger & Ralph's armies couldn't join together - Lanfranc sent army w Bishop Wulfstan to Roger & bottled them up in River severn
    - Anglos and Normans joined together to prevent Ralph breaking out of East Anglia - both forces trapped
3. Danes arrived late - had 200 ships, serious threat - but gave time for Lanfranc to organise - saw revolt failing and didn't intervene + William had time to return - attacked, plundered York and went home 
## Norman England - 1066 - 88
### Feudal system & Church
Feudal system - hierarchical - Wil directly owned 25% land, grant rest to 200 tenants for loyalty+military allegiance(homage), taxes, supply knights & fight for king (tenants-in-chief = Barons&Lords). 
 - 1. Raise army - 4-5000 knights - tenants gave land to knights, if promise to fight for 40 days, pay homage & taxes (knight service)
 - W - reward/punish followers, gather taxes, raise army, keep control
 - 2. could take land back if tenants disloyal/failed to fulfill duties - when died, King chose who got land, usually son/relative - had to pay a tax (relief) to prove loyalty
 - 3. By the end, only 3% of land was Anglos - Wil had full control
 - Peasants did 'labour service' - worked on Knights' land 3 days a week - had to grow all food & most not allowed to move but got protection - knights could go and fight
Knight service - Barons, lords - provide knights for 1-2 months per year to King - equipment & money from tenant
 - Knights = new thegns - local lords, often ran manor courts
Forfeiture - William could give and take anyone's land
Ceremony of homage - William could take parts of inheritance and make everyone and families assets dependent on him
Church:
 - provided clerks & record-keepers to King - most of society couldnt read/write, many in church could - taught people to read/write
 - Abbots & bishops among best-educated in country, always literate - often joined Witan & advised King
### Government
Stigand - Archbishop Canterbury, corrupted: 1) used power to increase personal wealth - bishop for multiple regions, earned more money. 2) appointed jobs in Church based on money they would pay him, rather than merit of person - replaced by Lanfranc
Castles - keep control:
- used to stop resistance - motte & bailey design - could be built easily & quickly - Dover built in 8 days. about 500 castles built during Wil's reign
- built at strategic points - London, York, Warwick, border of wales - symbol of power
- offered protection to locals, useful for winning support over anglos 
Domesday book - 1085 - massive England census-who owned what - 13,500 villages/towns, 18 towns had 2000+ people
 - Norman England mainly traded in: Livestock, fish, salt & wool
 - 10% of 2 million population = slaves. 13,418 different places.
 - Bishops & Abbots owned 26% of land
 - 1. Financial - raise taxes to fund defense - 1085 Wil raised geld tax to defend from viking attack - DB made clear what feudal obligations were owed, no arguing - helped raise money to equip army, build castles, cathedrals, show power & keep control
 - 2. Defense
 - 3. Legal - clear records to stop disputes - Some saxons got land returned back illegally from Normans - sorted out land
Burgess - citizen of a town
 - If city large enough, can ask King for charter of independence
Regents - people used to rule England when William was in Normandy: Lanfranc, Odo Bayeux, William FitzOsbern
Demesne - money sheriffs paid so they can manage King's land/estates - money after demesne, sheriffs kept
Forest laws - more hunting land for Wil. & court - anyone 'poaching' Will's animals/damaging his plants= harshly punished(e.g blinded)
### William I & Sons
William Rufus (William I) - coronated 1087 - Odo supported his son Robert Curthose more than him

        - He was the leader of the colony
    - Wancheso and Manteo were two Native Americans that Walter Raleigh brought back to London in 1584
    - A violent storm called Puerto Rico destroyed most of the supplies as it hit The Tiger - the name of the ship with all the supplies.
        - This meant that the Native Americans had to share some of their supplies with the English, as they didn't have much of their own.
    - Mid June 1585, they arrived at Roanoke Island
- James Wolfe - Battle Of Quebec in 1759
    - The Battle Of Quebec
        - The Battle of Quebec was very important because whoever won that battle would gain control of Canada and the 13 American colonies
        - The Battle Of Quebec was part of the Seven Years War which lasted seven years from 1756 - 1763
        - Quebec was also at the mouth of the Saint Laurence river.
            - This river was very important for trade and commerce
        - Quebec was heavily guarded with thousands of French Soldiers commanded by General Montcalm
            - General Montcalm was the Leader of the French
        - Quebec was situated ontop of a sheer cliff called the HEIGHTS OF ABRAHAM
        - General Montcalm made a massive mistake! This could of been the reason the French lost the battle.
        - General Montcalm allowed some of his men to help local farmers with the harvest.
            - This a lot left less men guarding Quebec.
        - The British had won the Battle and the French were defeated.
    - James Wolfe
        - The Row Formation
            - The Formation would normally have 3 rows. The first and second row would kneel down and the third row would stand up and shoot.
            - After the third row shot, they would reload their muskets and the first row would stand up and shoot.
            - After the First row shot, they would reload and the second row would stand up and shoot.
            - By the time that the first and second row had shot, the third row would be ready to fire.
            - This cycle would repeat over and over, leading to a constant fire.
            - The Row Formation was a good formation that Wolfe used in the Battle of Quebec.
        - Born in English county of Kent

        - James Wolfe had better strategies and tactics than the French, Wolfe thought everything out well.
        - The Heights of Abraham
            - There was an easier but longer route to get to the Heights Of Abraham
                - The French were expecting the British (James' army) to take this route.
                - James ordered his men to climb to the Heights Of Abraham (longer route)
                    - This really surprised the French and they were not prepared for their attack
        - James made his army smaller but better by keeping only the fit and good soldiers and the bad ones he would get rid of.
            - This is because the not so fit people would be a liability
        - When the British climbed the cliff, the French started panicking and Montcalm ordered his men to attack
            - The French rushed towards the British
            - James Wolfe ordered his men not to fire their muskets until the French were in firing range of 36 metres.
                - Muskets back then didn't have good accuracy so he wanted the Men to be in range to make sure the bullets hit.
                    - James Wolfe also put 2 bullets in each musket.
            - When the English fired, hundreds of French soldiers were killed.
        - During the Battle, Wolfe was wounded twice and died shortly after the battle.
