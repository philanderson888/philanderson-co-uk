## Physical Landscapes in the UK

### Coasts
4 Processes of Erosion (coasts & rivers):
1) Hydraulic action - the sheer impact of waves, and traps air in cracks, increasing pressure on rock
2) Abrasion - the waves carry rock that get thrown into the cliff face, breaking away rock
3) Attrition - particles carried by the waves break down as they collide with each other
4) Solution - soft rocks dissolving in the seawater
Fetch - length of water over which the wind has blown
Rock arrangement
Mechanical weathering - breakdown of rocks without any chemical change (freeze-thaw, onion-skin)
Chemical weathering - breakdown of rocks with the mineral composition being changed
Biological weathering - breakdown of rocks caused by nature
Swash - power of wave moving up the beach
Backwash - power of wave going down the beach back to the sea
Constructive wave - smaller, gentler waves - strong swash, weak backwash
Destructive wave - bigger waves - weak swash, strong backwash
4 methods of material transportation:
1) Traction - large boulders pushed along water bed
2) Saltation - hopping or bouncing pebbles, too heavy to be suspensed
3) Suspension - rocks carried within the water
4) Solution - dissolved rock carried in the water
Longshore drift - the movement that the waves carry rocks/beach amterial in correlation to prevailing wind
Estuary - end of the river
Scarp - steep cut in side of a slope
Deposition - dropping off of material, how beaches build up
Groynes - wooden/stone fences built adjacent to coast, trap material from Longshore drift
Discordant coastline - coast made up of alternating bands of hard and soft rock vertially, at right angles to the coast.
Concordant coastline - coast made up of alternating bands of hard and soft rock horizontally, parallel to coast
Shoreline - zone between high tide and low tide
##### Landforms
Headland - hard rock that juts out to sea - erodes from a crack --> cave --> arch --> stack --> stump
Bay - a crescent shaped indentation on a coastline - usually a beach - soft rock inbetween hard rock
Beach - sand/shingle - formed by constructive waves depositing material - shingle beaches made from more destructive waves
Spit - form at sharp bends in coastline - LSD deposits material past bend into sea - Strong winds/waves can curve end of spit (recurved end). Area behind spit sheltered from waves, becomes mud flat or salt marsh.
Bar - spit that joins two headlands together.
Lagoon - little pool in the middle of a bar
Wave-cut notch - notch formed from the base of the cliff being eroded
Sand dune - sand deposited is moved up beach by wind, obstacles(e.g driftwood) break wind speed - sand is deposited forming embryo dune - vegetation stabilises sand, encouraging more deposition - embryo dune --> foredune --> Mature dune
Dune slack - tiny pools formed in hollows between dunes
##### Defences
Hard engineering - man-made structures built to control the flow of sea and reduce flooding or erosion
1) Sea wall - concave hard wall, reflects waves back to sea. Adv:very effective, durable | Dis: very expensive(£2k per metre), lasts 30-50 yrs
2) Rock armour - large boulders piled up along coats, break & absorb wave energy | Adv: fairly cheap, easy to maintain, can be used for fishing | Dis: unattractive, doesnt match local geology, need replacing often
3) Gabions - wall of wire cages of rocks - Absorb wave energy | Adv: cheap(£100 per metre), easy to build | Dis: look very ugly & unnatural, not long-lasting(wire cages corrode over time)
4) Groynes - wooden/stone fences built at right angles to coast - trap material from LSD| Adv: builds up beach - encourages tourism, fairly cheap | Dis: starve beaches further down coastline, leading to more erosion elsewhere, unattractive
Soft engineering - natural schemes set up using knowledge of sea to reduce effects of flooding/erosion
1) Beach nourishment - Sand/shingle pumped onto an beach to build it up | Adv: blends in with beach, attracts tourists | Dis: needs to be replaced constantly, sand has to be brought from elsewhere, pretty expensive
2) Reprofiling - taking sand from lower beach and adding it to upper part of beach | Adv: cheap, simple, works | Dis: Only works when wave energy is low, needs to be repeated continously
3) Dune regeneration - restoring sand dunes by planting vegetation to stabilise sand - | Adv: cheap, natural-looking, creates a barrier | Dis: protection limited to small area, can be damaged by weather, areas zoned off
Managed retreat - allow sea to flood land behind, become marshland | Adv: cheap, easy, doesnt need maintaining, can create new habitats for plants & animals, natural defence | Dis: Land lost, Landowners need compensation (5k-10k per hectare) 

### Rivers
Upper course - steep gradient - V-shaped valley - narrow, shallow channel - Waterfalls, gorges, interlocking spurs
Middle course - medium gradient - gently sloping valley sides - Wider, deeper channel
Lower course - Gentle gradient - Very wide, almost flat valley, Very wide and deep channel 
Source - start of the river
Vertical erosion - deepens river valley and channel - dominant in upper course
Lateral erosion - widens river valley and channel - during formation of meanders - dominant in middle & lower course.
4 Processes of Erosion (coasts & rivers):
- Hydraulic action - force of water colliding with rocks, traps air particles - puts pressure on rock, breaking rocks
- Abrasion - eroded rocks in river scrape against channel, wearing it away. Most common type of erosion(rivers)
- Attrition - eroded rocks in river crash into each other, break into smaller pieces. Particle size decreases along river
- Solution - river water dissolves soft rocks (e.g chalk, limestone)
4 methods of material transportation:
- Traction - large boulders pushed along water bed
- Saltation - hopping or bouncing pebbles, too heavy to be suspensed
- Suspension - rocks carried within the water
- Solution - dissolved rock carried in the water
Deposition - river drops material when it loses its velocity/energy - dominant in lower course - happens if there is less water, more eroded material, water is shallower, or when river reaches the mouth
Hydrograph - shows peak discharge, lag time, rising & falling limb with rainfall
Discharge - volume of river water flowing per second - measured in cumecs(cubic metres per second, m3/s)
Lag time - delay between peak rainfall and peak discharge - time for all rainfall to flow in river - surface runoff or infiltration underground
Rising limb - increase in river discharge, as rainwater flows into river
Falling limb - decrease in discharge, as river returns to normal level
Factors affecting flood risk:
1) Heavy rainfall - too much water to infiltrate - more surface runoff -  lag time shorter, more discharge
2) Geology(rock type) - impermeable rocks dont allow infiltration - runoff increased - more discharge
3) Prolonged rainfall - saturate soil - cant infiltrate further rainfall - runoff increased
4) Relief - surface runoff faster down slopes - increases discharge
5) Land use - buildings, roads are impermeable, drains quickly transport runoff to rivers, trees store water - reducing discharge
##### Landforms
Waterfalls - upper course - area of soft rock eroded after hard rock, creates a 'step', then a steep drop
Plunge pool - hard rock eventually undercut by erosion, unsupported and collapses - Collapsed rock swirls at bottom and erodes soft rock by abrasion, creating a plunge pool
Gorge - Waterfall when over time more undercutting happens and waterfall retreats, leaving hard rock sticking out on sides
Interlocking spurs - upper course - rivers cant laterally erode, winds around high hillsides that interlock with each other

Meanders - middle course - large bends in river - current is faster on outside bend as channel is deeper, erosion happens - slower on inside bend, material deposited - forms slip-off slopes
Thalweg - fastest flow of river - on outside bends
Ox-bow lakes -  U-shaped meander - river breaks through neck - river flows along shortest course - deposition cuts off meander - an ox-bow is formed

Flood plains - flat, wide valley area of land on sides of river - deposites material when flooded, builds up flood plain
Levees - natural embankments along edges of river channel - during flood, heaviest ma terial deposited closest to river, builds  up and creates levees on edges.
Estuaries - found at mouth - tidal area - floods deposit silt & sand & form mudflats. Mudflats exposed at low tide.
##### Defences
Hard engineering - man-made structures to control flow of rivers: 
1) Dams & reserviors - barriers built across rivers to trap water and release it in a controlled way. Reservoir forms behind dam. Adv: can generate HE power, attract tourists, prevent floods downstream | Dis: Veryy expensive, reservoir can flood existing settlements, sediment deposited in reservoir - farmland downstream less fertile, habitats flooded - rotting vegetation - releases methane(greenhoue gas)
2) Channel straightening - meanders removed by building straight, artificial channels. | Adv: water moves quicker, more water held at once - reduces flood risk | Dis: speeding up river may increase flood risk downstream, dredging needs doing frequently
   - Dredging - digging bottom of river so it can hold more water
3) Embankments - built raised walls along river bank | Adv: quite effective - river can hold more water, floods less likely | Dis: unnatural, quite expensive, risk of severe flooding if they break, or too short, water sped up increases flood risk downstream
4) Flood relief channels - divert water around built-up areas and join river later down course | Adv: Removes excess water from river, gates on channels - release of water is controlled | Dis: Expensive, can cause flooding where relief channel joins the river back   
Soft engineering:
1) Flood warnings - Environmental Agency - warnings through TV, radio, internet | Adv: residents can prepare sandbags/flood boards & move possessions upstairs, evacuate - reduces impact | Dis: Don't prevent flood, people may not have access to warnings, modifying buildings is expensive, doesn't guarantee safety - flash floods happen quickly
2) Flood plain zoning - restricting building on floodplains that are likely to flood | Adv: risk reduced - fewer impermeable surfaces created(roads), impact is less, buildings wont be as damaged | Dis: Cant help areas with existing buildings, urban expansion limited, planners have to decide what type of flood to plan for
3) Planting trees - intercepts rainwater | Adv: increases lag time, decrease discharge, reduces soil erosion, provides habitats | Dis: less land available for farming
4) River restoration - making river natural (eg. removing levees) so can flood naturally | Adv: Little maintenance needed, discharge reduced, better habitats | Dis: Local flood risk can increase

## The Living World
### Ecosystems
Biotic - living
Abiotic - non-living
Ecosystem - all biotic and abiotic things working together to live in an area
Producer - greens - uses sunlight energy to produce food
Consumer - gets its energy by eating other organisms, producers or consumers
Decomposer - organism that gets its energy by breaking down dead material, dead producers and consumers (fallen leaves or animal remains. Bacteria/ fungi)
Food chain - diagram - transfer of energy from ONE organism to another and another by eating
Food web - diagram - a network of food chains, linking multiple organisms in one ecosystem together - transfer of energy in an ecosystem.
Flora = plants, fauna = animals
Freshwater Pond ecosystem:
- Pond bottom - decomposers/scavengers live here - feed on dead material
### Tropical Rainforests
Climate - 20-28C over year, high rainfall - 2000mm per year - rains every day
Epiphyte - plants that grow on other plants, take nutrients/moisture from air (e.g fern, orchids)
Soil - isn't fertile - heavy rain washes nutrients away. There are surface nutrients
Animals - believed to have more species than any other ecosystem.
Biodiversity - the variety of organisms living in an area, both plants and animals
Symbiotic relationship - where they each depend on each other for survival
Cecropia trees - hollow stems, produce energy-rich foodstuff at base of their leaves
Plants - trees, evergreen - height, 50m+ - vegetation cover, dense - very little light reaches floor
Plant adaptations:
- thick, waxy leaves with pointed drip-tips - channel rainwater to point, encourage run-off - weight of water cant damage plant
- Smooth, thin bark - no need to protect trunk from cold weather. Smooth surface - water run-off easier and quicker
- Large, stable buttress roots - support tall tree trunks, and get more nutrients
- Plants drop leaves gradually throughout year - meaning they grow all year round

## Natural Hazards
Geological hazards - hazard caused by land and tectonic processes - volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides
Meteorological hazards - hazards caused by weather and climate
Hazard risk - probability of people being affected by a hazard in an area
Primary effects - immediate impacts caused by hazard itself
Secondary effects - impact that happen after as a result of the primary effects.
Tectonic plates - plates that make up our crust
Crust - Earth's outer layer
Continental Crust - thicker (30-50km) and less dense
Oceanic crust -  thinner (5-10km) and more dense
Mantle - layer after crust
Destructive plate margin - two plates colliding towards each other:
 oceanic + continental --> denser oceanic plate subducted(forced down into mantle) & destroyed, creating gas rich magma. Volcanoes and ocean trenches occur here.
 oceanic + oceanic --> cooler, denser one subducts into mantle.
 continental + continental --> ground folds upwards --> fold mountains.
Constructive plate margins - two plates moving away from each other - magma rises from mantle to fill gap & cools, making new crust
Conservative margins - two plates sliding sideways past each other, or same direction at different speeds

        - Some that pay rent pay more than half their salary towards it.
        - People in wealthy areas tend to live longer than those in poorer areas. The 2011 census showed the most people who reported themselves as not in good health, live in areas of low income.
        - Social deprivation - over 2 million people living in poverty.
        - Clear inequality in exam grades across London. Schools in areas of high deprivation score lowest GCSE points per pupil.
    - Urban Sprawl
        - The edges of cities are known as the rural urban fringe. There has been increased housing redevelopments in these areas, despite greenbelt laws protecting the land. This outward spread is known as urban sprawl.
    - Environmental
        - Dereliction
            - 250 hectares of brownfield site wasteland, that can be used
            - Expensive to clear old buildings, clean up sites.
            - Unattractive for investment
        - Building on Green and brown field sites
            - Greenfield site - any area of land that has not been developed previously
                - Building on these sites may reduce traffic and congestion
                - Easier to build on as nothing need to be cleared, and more attractive to retail parks
                - Land is often cheaper so commercial and housing development can be larger.
                - Wildlife may be lost and habitats may be destroyed.
                - Government reluctant to allow development on this land, harder to gain planning permission
                - People may protest towards building on these sites
                - Strict planning regulation needed.
            - Brownfield site - old industrial or inner site site that is cleared for a new building development
                - Brownfield redevelopment eases pressure on greenfield sites
                - More sustainable - good to reuse land
                - Easier to get planning permission by government
                - Infrastructure already exists in urban areas
                - House prices increase in inner city areas as people are encouraged back into area.
                - development results in more people coming to the area - puts strain on local services
                - Hazardous material from a previous land may need to be removed
        - Greenbelt - an area of open land consisting of farmland, woodland, open recreational areas. They are protected by law from new building, unless government deems it necessary to build there
        - Waste disposal
            - A lot of waste ends up in landfill sites or is burnt - Wasting resources and food, burning increases climate change.
            - In a year 39 million cubic meters of sewage flows into the River Thames
- Opportunities & sustainability
    - Economic
        - Transport -TFL and crossrail
            - Crossrail - £40m benefit to the UK economy
            - Crossrail - Better links to the capitals major commercial and business districts - Heathrow, the west end
            - Crossrail - 55,000 full time jobs and 75,000 business opportunites during construction of railway
    - Environmental
        - Waste disposal
            - If we can get zero landfill by 2025 will give london more space for housing and infrastructure.
            - Increase London’s energy from organic and non-recycled waste - can power millions of homes and save electricity and money.
        - Green space
            - 47% of London is green space.
            - green space lower than before due to people paving driveways and horizontal expansion for houses and buildings
            - Reduce stress and help mental wellbeing
            - Cardiovascular health - More space, easier to exercise
            - Improves air quality from trees

### Urbanisation
- there are 21 megacities
- Megacity - a city with over 10 million people
- 7 in 10 people will live in megacities by 2050
- Urbanisation - the increase in the proportion of the worlds population living in cities and urban areas.
- Urbanisation is higher for LICs then HICs because people move into cities for jobs and money. The healthcare is also worse there meaning a higher death rate but also a higher birth rate because cant afford contraception etc
- Reasons for urbanisation
    - Natural increase - This happens when the birth rate is higher than the death rate.
        - When there is a high proportion of young adults and more children are likely to be born.
        - A smaller population of older people means lower death rate.
        - Improvements in healthcare mean lower death rate.
    - Rural to urban migration - people moving from a rural area to an urban area due to push and pull factors
        - Pull factors
            - more well-paid jobs
            - A higher standard of living
            - Friends and family living there
            - Better chance of education
            - Public transport is better
            - More entertainment and activities
            - Better medical facilities
        - Push factors
            - Farming is hard and poorly paid
            - Drought and climate hazards reduce crop yields
            - Farming is often subsistence level, producing enough for the family, leaving nothing to sell
            - Poor harvest leads to malnutrition or famine
            - Few doctors or hospitals
            - Schools provide a very basic education
            - Rural areas isolated due to poor roads

    - Industrial structure - the relative proportion of workforce employed in different sectors of the economy (primary, secondary, tertiary, quarternary)
    - Primary - involves gathering raw materials from the Earth (fishing, farming, mining)
        - Primary is just above 50% of the workforce, but only generates around 17% of its GDP.
    - Secondary - involve making, building or processing raw materials into finished products, usually (factories, car manufacturers, builders, steel workers)
        - Secondary is around 22% of the workforce, and generates 30% of its GDP
    - Tertiary - provides a service to others (teachers, lawyers, doctors, bus drivers)
    - Quarternary - do high-tect research to develop new things (programmers, IT specialists, financial planners)
        - Tertiary and Quarternary is about 28% of the workforce, but generates most of India’s GDP of 53%
- TNCs in India
    - TNC - TransNational Corporation - a company that has operations in more than one country. Many TNCs are large and have well-known brands
    - Unilever - big food and consumer goods manufacturers.
    - Advantages of TNCs
        1. **Provide employment** - Unilever employs 16,000 people in India
        2. **Greater income from tax** - Unilever has annual sales of over $4.5 billion
        3. Some TNCS runs **development programs** in India - Project Shakti helps poor women in rural villages become entrepreneurs by providing loans and products to sell.
        4. Unilever works with **charities** - help run hygiene education programs and provide sanitation to 115 million people in India.
    - Disadvantages of TNCs
        1. Some profits from TNCs leave India - Unilever is a Dutch-British language company
        2. Can cause **environmental problems** - mercury contaminated glass from a Unilever factory was not disposed safely. Mercury is a poisonous chemical.
        3. TNCs may move around India to take advantage of local government incentives.


### Development
- Causes of uneven development
    - Historical
        - Colonialism - left colonised countries weak and without resources, making it a lot harder for them to climb and develop.
    - Physical
        - Landlocked
        - Weather
        - Size of country
        - Natural disasters
- Ways of closing the development gap
    - HICs giving aid and investing into LICS/NEEs
    - The multiplier effect - HICs investing in infrastructure like schools, roads and services.
    - Tourism - can generate a lot of money and for good tourist countries be a big part of their economy. Easy to invest into tourism.
        1. A growth in number of jobs in tourist industry
        2. Local people earn more money from working in tourist industry
        3. Local people spend more money in local businesses
        4. Taxes to the government from businesses and people go up
        5. Government has more money for improving infrastructure and attractions, to bring more tourists
        6. More tourists arrive (loop back to 1)



## Resource Managemenmt
Resource - stock/supply of an essential item with value or purpose
Food: not enough = malnourishment & undernourishment - limit children's development, increase ill chance
Water: drink,cook, wash - need sanitation, or gets polluted by raw sewage - diseases(cholera) from water kill many people per year.
Energy: Industry, transport, homes - electricity needed for development - Lifestyles in HICs depend largely on stable supply of energy. In LICs, no electricity = deforestation, releasing harmful fumes(kerosene stoves)
- consumption of resources depends on countries wealth & availability
Insecurity - when people don't have enough supply of it to be sustainable
#### Food
Malnourished - bad diet - can be fat
Undernourished - not enough nutrients - skinny
Change in demand: Before 1960s, most fruit & veg were locally produces and seasonal - incomes increased=exotic fruit/veg/spices/coffee are more popular - often exported from LICs.
   - Seasonal - Fruit and veg are imported all year round to meet demand for seasonal produce
   - Organic - people concerned about environmental impacts of food production - organic strictly regulated, demand growing. Most is imported.
Carbon Footprint - amount of greenhouse emissions produced from production of food. Higher footprint=global warming
  - 10% of UK greenhouse emissions in 2017 from agriculture. 
  - Imported foods have many food miles
  - People becoming aware - looking for local sources of food(farmers markets, farm shops) 
Food miles - distance food is transported to market. More food miles = more CO2 pollution
Agribusiness - large-scale, industrial farming controlled by large firms. Led to:
   - farm sizes increased - food produced more cheaply - more land use
   - chemicals in food production increasing - artificial fertilisers, pesticides, special food for animals
   - workers in agriculture fell to 1.1% of UK total employment 2017 - due to machinery
#### Case study - Thanet Earth
Thanet Earth - agribusiness in Kent
- heated greenhouse (28oC) to grow in-demand crops all year + same amount of light
- cable drips water, nitrogen, phosphate, potassium & magnesium - 50m gallons water in reservoirs
- covered in white to reflect sunlight
- each building own heat & power plant - use mains gas for electricity 
### Water
50% UKs water used in toilet, baths
21% demand wasted through leakage
Demand for water rise by 51% by 2030
Main sources: rivers, reserviors, aquifers
- 2006 - water grid to transfer water from surplus to deficit
### Energy
Energy use fallen:
1. Deindustrialisation
2. Energy-efficient tech (washing machines, cars)
3. Insulation
1990 - coal for 70% energy
2007 - 35% gas, 30% nuclear+coal
2022 - gas 40%, Wind 30%
Nuclear PP:
- very expensive
- Decommisionning old PP expensive
- construction gives job opportunities, boost local economy
distribution uneven - development gap, economy

### Rice Husks Bihar India
- rice husk - biomass - waste product burnt in Power plant
- 84 PPs by 2015 - supply 200,000
- PPs also provide employment - management/building
- using biomass reduce fossil fuels - 0% c emissions

## Poem - The Water Cycle Rap

```
The Water Cycle, It's so amazing
So it starts with the sun blazing
that Heats up the water,
 that's Evaporation!
Water vapor rises around the nation,
Turns into gas, which we call cloud,
that's Condensation!
 Then, The clouds will enshroud
 and Turn greyer
Water cools down because of the heat
Makes some rain, snow, hail or sleet
That's precipitation!
Then the hills get a pouring of water
That runs down them Back into,
the Rivers, Streams, and Lakes
That goes into the air, turning into gas
 that Then precipitates down to the ground 
and it repeats as a cycle
That's the Water Cycle!
```

## **Revision**

## Weathering

- Weathering and erosion constantly attack rocks. Weaker rocks are weathered faster than harder, stronger, more resistant rocks.
- Freeze-thaw weathering
    - When it rains water will fill the cracks in rocks.
    - The water will freeze and put pressure on the rock, making it crack even more.
    - Then the ice would melt back to water.
    - The process keeps repeating until the rock is broken.
- Onion-skin weathering is when the outer layer seperates from the rock. One form of this weathering is exfoilation, where the outer layer of the rock is peeled off by the weather.
    - Exfoilation happens because rocks expand during the day in hot temperatures and then contract again during the cooler night-time temperatures. This constant movement over thousands of years finally causes the outer layer to peel away. The process will then repeat with the next layer
- Biological weathering happens when plants or animals break down rocks
- Chemical weathering is when the chemical composition of rock changes. When the climate is warm and wet, carbonic dioxide can dissolve in rain to create a carbonic acid. The carbonic acid in the rainfall hits the rocks and dissolved the parts of the rock made of calcium carbonate.

## Erosion

- Erosion is when earth material is worn away because of natural forces like wind, water, glaciers and others
    - Four remaining features of erosion are Headlands, Bays, Cliffs
    - Ways of Erosion
        - Hydraulic action - This is the sheer power of the waves as they smash against the cliffs. Air gets trapped inside the rocks and causes the rock to break apart.
        - Abrasion - This is when pebbles and small rocks grind along a rock surface, breaking off pieces of rock but also making the rock smoother over time.
        - Attrition - This is when rocks that the sea is carrying collide and knock against each other, making the rocks break apart into more smaller rocks.
        - Solution - This is when sea water dissolves certain types of rock. In the UK, chalk and limestone are prone to this type of erosion.

## Coasts

- Coastal Defences
    - Sea Wall
        - This is a curved wall on the coast/beach that works by deflecting all the water and energy back into the sea. The destructive wave crashes into the C-shaped curve, then all the water goes up the curve, and drops down, crashing on itself. A sea wall is the most effective but it is also the most expensive. Sea walls have a lot of durability (long life span). This also can increase the erosion of beach material. This is a hard-engineering technique.
    - Dune Regeneration
        - Dune Regeneration is when they grow grass on the dunes to stabilise them. When a big, destructive wave hits, it's energy and speed is reduced by travelling aver the dunes. This method helps stop the sea eroding the beach.
    - Groynes
        - These work by stopping and collecting LSD (Longshore Drift). They trap sand and sediment and build up a big beach. As destructive waves travel over the beach, they will lose their energy. These are cheap and dont affect access to the beach. The thing bad about this is the beaches further down the coast don't get much LSD.
    - Gabions
        - A Gabion works by absorbing the waves energy. They put a wire cage filled with rocks on the beach which slows down the destructive wave as it is forced through the gap. This method is cheap and efficient. It also doesn't make the beach look nice and has a shorter life span than sea wall.
    - Beach Nourishment
        - It works by taking sand from far out at sea, sucking it through a pipe, and pumping it to the area where you want to build up a beach. The beach slows down destructive waves due to friction. This stops erosion as it protects the land behind the beach. Storms will require beach replenishment, increasing costs. This is a Soft-engineering technique.
- A Spit is an extended bit of beach material that stretches out to sea and on one end is joined to the mainland.

## Glaciation - Ice

- An Ice Age occurs when there is a reduction in temperature both in the atmosphere and on land. This drop in temperature causes ice sheets to form.
- An Interglacial lasts around 10,000 years and are warmer periods of time! We are currently in an interglacial!
- A glacial lasts around 100,000 years and are very cold periods of time.
- Glacial ice can be found at three scales:
    - Ice Sheets - The largest out of these three.
        - The largest Ice sheet is in Antarctica and covers 98%!
        - Ice sheets are blankets of ice that extend more than 50,000sq km.
        - They also contain about 99% of the world's freshwater ice.
        - Ice sheets are so heavy that they bend the Earth's crust.
        - Every continent has an ice sheet expect from Australia/Oceania.
        - The North (Greenland) and the South (Antarctica) have the most ice.
    - Ice caps
        - Ice caps are often found near the edge of an ice sheet.
        - These are less than 50,000 square km in size.(smaller than ice sheets)
    - Glaciers
- Glaciers
    - A giant extremely destructive lake of ice that moves very very slowly downhill.
    - There are different types of glaciers such as Polar, Alpine or mountain glaciers.
    - Glaciers cause erosion by carrying rocks underneath themselves after breaking them off mountains/rocks.
    - Glaciers develop over many years in places where snow has fallen but not melted. Snow gets compacted and turns to ice. More and more ice forms and the weight of the ice/glacier gets heavier, meaning it starts to slip down
    - Zone of Accumulation - The place in the glacier where snow falls. This is normally at the start of a glacier. More snow falls and it compacts so the bottom of the glacier becomes ice.
    - The end of a glacier is the the snout.
    - Zone of Ablation - Near the end of the glacier (the snout) the ice may melt. This is the zone of ablation and it most likely happens in summer.

## World Issues

- Corona-virus
- Global warming
- Poverty
- Pollution
    - Air pollution
- Drought
- Glaciers melting
- Deforestation
- Greenhouse gas effect
    - When chemical gases are released into the air from burning fossil fuels or air pollution create a layer around the earth, trapping heat inside. This leads to global warming.
        - Gases like Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Hydrogen and Methane can be a result of burning fossil fuels

## China

- Three Georges Dam
    - Largest Dam in the World
    - Uses Hydroelectric power
    - Dams are used on rivers to control the amount of water that flows through the river.
        - Dams also can be used to generate hydroelectric energy
    - The three Georges dam is located in Zigui County, Yichang, China and is on the Yangtze River.
    - The reservoir behind the Three Georges Dam is 410 miles long! This is around the length of England to Glasgow
    - The dam is 185m high. (60 stories)
    - Biggest concrete structure in the world
    - Over 2 kilometres long
    - 40,000 workers and over 17 years to build
    - This dam will produce 20 megawatts an hour
    - Had to divert the Yangtze river and move a lot of people before they could start building
    - The dam used 28 million metres of concrete
- They are roughly circular and completely blanket the landscape and even mountainous areas.
- 1 Child Policy
    - Population
        - In 1950, the population was 500 million. Now its 1.4 Billion
    - The 1 Child Policy was a Policy that China made to stop the rapid increase in their population and to stabilise the Birth to Death Rate. What it means is that in each family they can have only 1 child.
    - Women would be sterilized and fined for having a second child
    - One Quarter of Chinese men won't be married in the late 30's by 2040
    - There are more young educated women in Chinese society today than ever. Nearly 50% of all undergraduates and graduated are female.
    - The 1 Child Policy increased the number of abortions and female infanticide.
    - There are more boys than girls, resulting in a lack of brides. This has led to human trafficking where brides are bought from Vietnam and Cambodia illegally.
    - More attention and gifts are lavished on the only child by parents and grandparents.
    - 400 million births were prevented by this policy
    - The reduced number of births has reduced the pressure on food and energy resources
    
- China has a population of over 1.4 Billion!
- China's capital is Beijing
- China has a land mass 9.597 million km squared
- China's name is the People's republic of China.
- The national animal of China is the Giant Panda
- Most of China's population live in the South East and the rest of China is not very populated.
- One of the fastest growing economies on earth.

## Rocks

- Igneous rock is formed when magma from the Earth's mantle cools and hardens
    - Igneous rocks like granite is used as kerbstones and in kitchen worktops because it is extremely durable
    - Basalt is often crushed and used as a base for making roads
- Metamorphic rocks are formed when heat and pressure cause something to form into a rock. The resulting rocks are harder and more compact.
    - Metamorphic rocks like slate are used on roofs as it is easy to split, durable and impermeable.
- Sedimentary rocks are formed from layers of sand and sediment building up over time and getting crushed and compacted until they are a rock from sediment. Things like chalk, clay and limestone are sedimentary.
    - Sedimentary rocks like limestone are used as building blocks or to produce cement.
        - Limestone is easily quarried
        - Some limestones are softer and easier to carve
        
    - Gritstone is used to make grinding wheels as it is very abrasive

## Year 9 EOY Test revision

- Plate Tectonics
    - Volcanoes and Earthquakes occur along tectonic plate margins
    - The 4 layers of the earth are: Crust, Mantle, Outer core, Inner core
    - Volcanoes and Earthquakes occur along plate margins because the tectonic plates dont fit together so they will either collide, diverge or slide past each other. This causes earthquakes and volcanic activity

- Development
    - Development can be measured in lots of ways like life expectancy, economy of the country and education. If the country has better education it will normally have a better economy. You can also look at the HDI of a country to see how developed it is.

# GCSE Geography

## Physical Landscapes In The UK

- Rivers
    - Landforms
        - Waterfalls - Upper course - When a river flows over an area of hard rock, followed by an area of soft rock. Soft rock is eroded, creating a step in the river. A steep drop is eventually created
        - Gorge - when the hard rock is undercut by erosion, causing the top to become unsupported and collapse. The collapsed rock erode plunge pool by erosion and creates a deep plunge pool. Waterfalls retreat, leaving behind a gorge.
        - Interlocking Spurs - Upper course - Steep-sided, V-shaped valleys which winds around high hillsides, because they cant laterally erode, which interlock with each other like a zip.
        - Meanders - middle and lower course - faster on outside bend, deposition happens on inside bend and creates a slip-off slope
        - Ox-bow lakes - When meanders get too large, and that they create a U shape, and cut across, leaving an ox-bow lake.
        - Flood-plain - lower course - wide valley floor on the side of the river which usually floods, and deposition happens building up the floodplain
        - Levees - lower course - natural embankments along edges of a river channel. Created from heavy eroded material deposited closest to river channel, which builds up and creates levees.
        - Estuary - Found at river mouth - tidal water areas where river floods frequently, and mud is deposited and mudflats are built on sides.

        - Suspension - small particles like silt and clay are carried along by water
        - Solution - soluble rock dissolve in the river and are carried along.
    - Deposition - when a river drops the material its transporting, happens when river loses speed and energy.

    - high rainfall of 2000mm per year. Rains every day
    - Soil - isnt fertile as heavy rain washes nutrients away. There are surface nutrients
    - Biodiversity - the variety of organisms living in an area - both plants and animals.
    - Symbiotic relationship - where they both depend on each other for survival
    - Animals
        - Adaptations
            - have strong limbs to move around habitat quickly and easily
            - Birds have short, pointed wings to easily manoeuvre between the dense tangle of trees
            - Suction cups help some animals (tree frogs) climb, others have flaps of skin to help them glide between trees
            - Camouflaged - leaf - tailed geckos look like leaves, so they can hide from predators
            - Nocturnal - sloths - feed at night when its cooler to help them save energy.
            - Many animals can swim to help them cross river channels.
        - Believed to have more species than any other ecosystem
    - Plants
        - Adaptations
            - Thick, waxy leaves with pointed drip-tips to channel rainwater, encouraging run-off, so weight of water doesnt damage the plant
            - Smooth, thin bark as no need to protect trunk from cold weather. Also helps water to run-off more easily.
            - Large, stable buttress roots to support the tall trees’ trunks and to get nutrients.
            - Drop their leaves gradually throughout year so they can grow all year round
        - trees are evergreen and can grow up to 50m
        - vegetation cover is dense, very little light reaches the forest floor
        - Epiphyte - plants that grow on other living plants, and take nutrients and moisture from the air. (fern, orchids)
        - Cecropia trees - hollow stems, produce an energy-rich foodstuff at base of their leaves
- Hot Deserts - Mojave Desert
    
- Ecosystems
    - Ecosystem - all the biotic(living) and abiotic(non-living) parts of an area interjoined that work together to survive in an area. Tundras, Grassland, Boreal forests, Tropical rainforests, Deciduous forests, Polar, Desert
    - Producer - something that uses photosynthesis to produce food, a plant or grass
    - Consumer - something that gets its energy by eating other organisms. They can eat producers (Primary) or other consumers. Primary, secondary and tertiary.
    - Decomposer - an organism that gets energy from breaking down dead material, like dead leaves or animals etc. Bacteria and fungi are decomposers.
