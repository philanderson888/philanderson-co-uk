### Context
James I - written in 1606 - Shakespeare included many things to please King, e.g message of what would happen if betrayed King
- James was paranoid people were plotting against him, Macbeth acts as warning to Jacobean era that treasonous acts will be punished
- James had deep fear of witches

Witchcraft - women who: lived alone, used herbs to cure illnesses, accused of witches - believed witches more powerful at night as God couldn't see what was happening - also believed to have a 'familiar'/evil spirit (cat,bat,owl) to do bidding
 - Witches seen as agents of devil, used to cause chaos and evil on earth.

Religion - England strongly Christian - commiting a sin would mean they went to Hell - God would 'punish' anyone who attempted sins like regicide - judgement and punishment = DIVINE RETRIBUTION
 - Divine Right of Kings - belief King chosen to rule by God, King=God's representative on earth. Regicide - worst possible sin - would be disrupting natural order, causing nature to be unbalanced.

Women - inferior sex - considered weaker, physically & mentally - over emotional, passive, maternal figures. Seen as possessions, first of fathers then husbands. L.Macbeth & Macbeth would be considered an anomaly 
- L.M asks spirits to strip her of her femininity to be more masculine - so she can be stronger & aggressive to commit crimes - power & status of Macbeth & L.M alternates throughout play - they subvert gender roles.
### Themes:
Ambition:
Ambition - leads to evil - makes Macbeth stronger & more determined, but destroys his wife - eventually kills him too, becomes a tyrant & loses support
Hamartia - his fatal flaw - "I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition" - his only motivation - need for power. Lady Macbeth also has same hamartia
Power:
Mac sacrifices goodness for power - desire to maintain power makes his paranoid, making him make evermore irrational decisions and become a tyrant.
- Malcolm = foil to Macbeth, he has power but is not corrupt - good and fair.




Supernatural - Witches - agents of Devil sent to cause havoc/misery. 
- Witches activities:
  - Control weather (thunderstorms)
  - Predict future, cast spells
  - Witches talk in own language - rhyming couplets - otherworldy
- Disruption of nature
  - storm when Duncan dies
  - Many unnatural occurences happen - horses eat each other, Owl kills falcon(represents macbeth killing Duncan, food chain disrupted.) Links to Great Chain of Being - unnatural death of king.
- Witches often shown as ugly & hag-like - demonstrates how evil corrupts both soul and appearance
L.M - links herself to supernatural - calls spirits to "take my milk for gall" - Gall believed to create anger and aggression.

Appearance and reality:
- Witches - mislead Macbeth/say 'half-truths' to allow him to mislead himself
- Euphemisms
- Visions - guilty conscience - "Mine eyes are made the fools o'th'other senses" & dagger vision
- Sleeps & dreams - Macbeth & wife have trouble sleeping - tormented by dreams
- Duality - L.m + Macbeth - "Look like the innocent flower but be the serpent under't"

Fate vs free will - Mac. recieves several prophecies by witches - don't know if witches could actually predict, or if Macbeth caused the events himself - fate or free will
Manipulation - L.M convinces Macbeth to kill King by belittling & questioning his manhood
    - Witches manipulate Macbeth by tempting him with greatness, and cause his own downfall by telling him half-truths.

Betrayal & guilt - Macbeth betrays Duncan - viewed as ultimate sin - previous Thane Of Cawdor beheaded for betraying King, foreshadows Macbeth's downfall and death.
  - Mac. also betrayed wife - gradually excluding her & showing little remorse for her death
  - Madness - consequence of guilt - "O full of scorpions is my mind" + Banquo's ghost= manifestation of madness. L.M shows madness through sleep-walking & disjointed speech & then suicide
### Symbolism
Visions - signs of guilty conscience floating dagger, 'murder sleep' voice, Banquo's ghost - never revealed whether hallucination or supernatural - like how nature became erratic when Duncan killed, Macbeths mind is same when it is forced to fight against itself.
  - Lady Macbeth - hallucinates blood on hand - clear sign of guilty conscience - "Out, damned spot!"

Blood - symbol of guilt, violence - deaths happen quickly, yet blood always stains; longer-lasting emotional & religious implications of murder. 
  - creates sense of horror for Jacobean audience, subsequent deaths as play develops to be more horrifying/shocking
  - L.M - feels no guilt at start, easily washes blood away - later blood stained on her hand, guilt has caught up to her - "a little water clears us of this deed" - Litotes + euphemism + irony

Sleep - reflects state of mind - symbolises innocence, purity, peace - Duncan murdered by Macbeth in sleep, hinting his innocence+purity
  - Macbeth - "Macbeth shall sleep no more", "Macbeth does murder sleep" - symptom of guilt and troubled mind
  - L.M - sleep walks when feels guilty, reflect her descent into madness

Weather - pathetic fallacy, reflects mood/atmosphere - bad weather = evil & supernatural, Thunder = witches - symbolises connection to devil & evil. Good weather = innocence, power of good over evil - beginning of play, day described as "fair" and "foul" - foreshadows duality of future events
 - Night/Day - symbolic of good/evil - believed God could not see what happened at Night, so evil would happen. Witches - "midnight hags" - linked to night. 
   - When duncan's body discovered - says it should be day, but it is still night - shows at moment, evil overpowers good

- Population doubled 1851-1901
Colonialism - British Empire largest in history - 1913, had power over 413 million people. - Britons lived, worked or served prison time in colonies

Police - areas of deprivation right next to areas of wealth - to maintain peace, police created. Seen as 'attack on liberty', policemen were corrupt & power-hungry. Their bumbling of cases (Jack Ripper) added to mistrust + incompetence. Representations of police are derogatory - "there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman."
 - Jack the Ripper - unidentified & uncaptured - Whitechapel, London 1888 - atleast 5 murders on women, all throats cut and mutilated - huge wave of public interest - brought negativity to police - looked incompetent
Detective novel - Holmes has wide knowledge & talent for deduction - accompanied by Watson - one step behind - adds to Holmes' aura and skill | Clues + Red herrings  - readers solves mystery with characters - interests reader
Indian revolution 1857 - forced Jonathan Small into hiding

#### Tonga

### Themes
Appearance - decieving - Thaddeus=unattractive, ungentlemanlike - Jones' prime suspect but innocent || Holmes notices details that seem useless but have huge importance ('Sign Of Four' letter)

Racism - Tonga reflects prevailing attitudes of time - 'animalistic', 'savage' - one character who doesnt seem to have human morals

Wealth - destruction of pursuit of wealth - Agra treasure negatively impacts everyone who desires it - ends lives of Small & tonga eg - Agra treasure creates romantic conflict w Mary & Watson - 'intervened like an impassable barrier', 'golden barrier was gone from between us' - scared she will think he is after money - social class at time strict
- Imperialism - Agra Treasure from India - under british rule 
  - T.Sholto apartment lavishly decorated with Eastern items - "two great tiger-skins" - empire was symbolic of wealth & power
  - Attitude towards imperialised people - 'savage instincts' - Tonga's instincts are murderous, creates crude image of islanders. | Tonga & Small - Tonga very devoted to small - "staunch and true, was little Tonga" - devotion naive, shows attitudes of Victorian society towards empire - 'little' = patronising, lacks empathy/respect for Tonga 
  - 

Modesty/humility - presented as extremely positive traits - those who dont seek material/societal gain portrayed in positive light | Watson + Mary emerge as happy & content fiancees, Holmes gains respect by allowing Jones to take credit for capture - rewards for having little interest in treasure.

Evil & justice - murders/crimes committed, + embodied by Tonga- depicted as 'inherently savage' and malicious. Greed = source of evil
 - Justice - M.Morstan - Th.Sholto feels she should get treasure after father kept treasure. Even on letter, it says she deserves justice. || J.Small - upset by injustice - believes treasure is rightly his, despite he murdered to get it - Holmes fair & doesn't accuse him of murdering Bartholomew - shows his sense of justice

Fear of: - foreigners - Tonga represents Victorian fear of otherness - 'savage, distorted creature' - presented as inferior and inhuman - Victorian belief that other races were inferior & dangerous
 - Darkness - most of novel set at night - murder, theft, betrayal occur
 - underclass - Th.Sholto separates himself from other social classes, surrounds himself with elegance/imperialism
 - social inequality - Watson & M.Morstan - "the golden barrier was gone from between us" - Watson feared Morstan would see him as only wanting her for money, and they would be in seperate social classes.
