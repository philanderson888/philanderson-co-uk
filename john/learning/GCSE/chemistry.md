J.J Thompson - 1897 - discovered electrons, created 'Plum Pudding model'
Ernest Rutherford - 1909 - fired positively charged alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold, some deflected and some went backwards. Concluded nucleus in the center, electrons around - 'Nuclear model'
Niels Bohr - Realised electrons orbit in fixed shells, with a fixed energy and distance. (Otherwise atom would collapse)
```

## C2 - Periodic table

Alloy - mixture of two elements, where atleast one is a metal

Metals - found in left and middle, have few outer shell electrons, lose or share electrons to get a full outer shell, become positive. 

Metal PROPERTIES:

- strong but malleable
- good heat and electricity conductors
- high melting & boiling points
- hard & shiny
- solids at room temp.
- Magnetic - iron, cobalt and nickel only

Non-metals - found in right and top, have more electrons on outer shell, react and gain or share electrons and become negative.

non-metal PROPERTIES:
- dull, brittle
- not always solid at room temp.
- don't conduct electricity
- lower density

Transition metals - middle of periodic table - properties:

- dense, strong, shiny conductors.
- often have more than one ion - Cu2+, Co3+
- Coloured
- make good catalysts in compounds

Alkali metals - Group 1 metals - soft, low density. Have 1 electron on outer shell, react with non-metals to form ionic compounds. Trend as you go DOWN group:

1) Increased reactivity - outer shell is further away from nucleus, weakening electrostatic forces, less energy required for it to be lost.

2) Lower melting & boiling points 

3) Higher atomic mass

Halogens - Group 7 non-metals - coloured vapours - all come as diatomic molecules, covalently bonded. Can either covalently bond or ionic bond with metals. Trend as you go DOWN the group:

1) Less reactivity - harder to gain electron when outer shell electrons are further away from nucleus, less attraction

2) Higher melting & boiling points - molecules increase in size = intermolecular forces increase = more energy needed 

3) Higher atomic mass

Noble gases - Group 0 - inert colourless gases - unreactive as they have full outer shell - monatomic gases, non-flammable. Trend as you go DOWN group:

1) Boiling point increases - number of electrons increase, greater intermolecular forces so more energy needed.

### discovery of periodic table

```
John Newlands - 1864 - ordered elements by atomic weight or R. atomic mass; noticed some patterns but table was incomplete.
Dimitri Mendelev - 1869 - ordered elements by atomic mass - put similar properties together - left gaps for undiscovered elements.
```
## C3 - Structure and bonding
```
Ionic bonding - metal and non-metal bond, transfer electrons  - metal becomes positive, non-metal becomes negative, which makes them attract
Dot and cross diagram
Ionic compounds - compound that contains ionic bonds.
Giant ionic lattice structure properties: 
- very strong as held together by electrostatic attraction in all directions
- high melting and boiling points
- Cant conduct electricity, when solid. When melted or dissolved, ions separate and can conduct electricity.

Empirical formula - simplest balanced ratio of elements for an equation
Covalent bonding - bonding between non-metals, positive nucleus attracted to shared nucleus, making covalent bonds very strong
Simple molecular structures - substances containing very stong covalent bonds, but held together by weak intermolecular forces:
- melting and boiling point very low
- Mostly gases or liquids at room temp
- as molecules get bigger, forces get stronger, boiling point increases
- Can't conduct electricity

Polymer - a long chain of repeated units, a long molecule
Macromolecules - giant covalent structures - diamond and graphite
Allotrope - the same element in the same state but with a different arrangement. Allotropes of carbon:

Diamond - each carbon atoms covalently bonds with 4 other carbon atoms.
- Making diamond really hard and strong. 
- Very high melting & boiling point. 
- Doesnt conduct electricity.

Graphite - arranged in sheets of hexagons, joined by intermolecular forces. Each carbon atom covalently bonded with 3. Layers are held weakly and can move over each other, making it soft and slippery, used for lubrication. 
- High melting and boiling point
- **CAN** conduct electricity - each carbon atom has 1 spare electron.

Graphene - one layer of graphite, strong and light, conductor.
Fullerene - hollow balls or nanotubes, made of hexagons and pentagons.
- Huge surface area
- good catalysts and lubricants
- conductor of electricity and heat
- high tensile strength

Metallic bonding - two metals bonding in a sea of delocalised electrons. Properties same as metals. (strong but malleable as layers can slide, high melting and boiling points, solids at room temp, conductors)
Alloy - mixture of atleast one metal. Harder than pure metals
States of matter - solid(s), liquid(l), gas(g), aqueous(aq)
- Other metals added to metals (Aluminium) = Metals have different sizes = layers distorted, cannot slide = alloy harder/strong
```
## C4 - Chemical calculations
```
Relative formula mass - atomic mass of all elements in the compound added together - Mr
Ar = (mass x percentage mass/abundance) for all isotopes / sum of % mass (100)z
Mole - 6.02x10^23 - One mole of an element is the same atomic mass as one atom of the element
Limiting reactant - the reactant that gets all used up and limits how much product is formed
Volume of gas = (mass of gas/Mr of gas) x 24, at room temperature and pressure.
Concentration - amount of solute there is in a given volume. - low concentration = dilute
Concentration(g/dm3) = mass of solute(g)/volume of solvent(dm3) (Can exchange mass with no. of moles)
Moles = mass/Mr, Mass = moles x Mr
Mole ratio - find original Mr, then divide the given Mr by it, to find the multiplier. Divide each element by original
Atom economy - the amount of useful product in the reactants. = (Mr of wanted product/Mr of all reactants) x 100
Percentage yield - the ratio of products formed to reactants used - % - product mass/ max mass
Titration - method of finding out concentration of ions - add increments of another solution until colour change
```
## C5 - Chemical changes

Acid - substance that produces H+ ions when dissolved in water. Has a pH of less than 7. 
Strong acids - ionise completely in water(aqueous solution), releasing more H+ ions. - react at a greater rate than weaker
Alkali - substance that produces OH- ions in water. pH > 7. (Bases that dissolve in water)
Base - any substance that makes a salt with an acid - has to be an ionic compound
Salt - compound formed when hydrogen ions in the acid are replaced by metal ions.
Neutralisation - acid + base --> salt + water
pH - measure of concentration of H+ ions in solution. has a base 10 logarithmetic scale
Acid + metal Oxide(base) --> salt + water
Acid + metal hydroxide(base) --> salt + water
Acid + metal carbonate(base) --> salt + water + carbon dioxide
MASH - Metal + acid --> salt + hydrogen 
 - Excess metal needs to be added to acid
 - Solution nees to be filtered into evaporating disk & concentrated by evaporation
Metal + water --> Metal hydroxide + hydrogen
Reactivity series:
Potassium
Sodium
Lithium
Calcium
Magnesium
Aluminium
(EXTRACTED BY ELECTROLYSIS)
***carbon***
Zinc
Iron
Tin
Lead
(EXTRACTED BY REDUCTION FROM CARBON)
***hydrogen***
copper, silver, gold, platinum

Metals below carbon are extracted by heating it up with carbon, as the carbon takes the oxygen away from the metal, making CO2, reducing the metal.
Displacement reaction - when a more reactive metal replaces a less reactive one in a compound
Ionic equation - where only elements getting oxidised or reduced are shown, and the rest are spectator ions.
Ores - natural rocks rich in useful metals, which can be extracted


## C6 - Electrolysis
```
Electrolysis - process of splitting up ionic compounds using electricity - very expensive
Electrolyte - solution that current is passed through, either molten ionic or aqueous
Electrode - cathode or anode - electrical graphite rods
Reduction - gain of electrons (loss of oxygen)
Oxidation - loss of electrons (gain of oxygen)
REDOX reaction - when both reduction and oxidation occur in the same reaction. Happens in all metal + acid reactions.
Extraction - for metals with high melting points, you lower the melting point by adding cryolite and make it molten
Cathode - negative electrode - attracts cations and forms a metal through reduction.
Anode - positive electrode - attracts anions - forms gas by oxidation.
Half equation for metals = Mx+ + xe- --> M
Half equation for nonmetals - 2Yx- ---> Y2 + 2xe-
Half eq. for hydrogen = 2H+ + 2e- ---> H2
Half eq. for hydroxide = 4OH- ---> O2 + 2H20
```


## C8 - Rates of reaction
```
Collision theory - Particles have to collide with enough energy for the collision to be successful
Activation energy - minimun amount of energy needed to break bonds and start reaction
Conservation of mass - in a chemical reaction, mass of reactants = mass of products
Reversible reaction - a reaction where the products are able to turn back into reactants

Rate of reaction factors:
1) Temperature - more temp = more kinetic energy in particles - particles move faster | more frequent, successful collisions
2) Concentration/pressure - more concentration = more particles in same volume | more frequent collisions
3) Surface area - breaking up a solid into smaller parts increases its surface area: volume ratio - more particles exposed to surface of other reactant = more space to collide = more frequent collisions
4) Catalyst - speeds up a reaction, without being used up - decreases activation energy needed - provides an alternate pathway with a lower activation energy

Practicals: 
1) Colour change - black cross - add chemical - record how long it takes for black cross to disappear (high turbidity)
2) Change in mass - substance reacts with liquid - evaporation out of beaker - record mass at regular intervals - quicker the mass drops, faster the reaction - plot a graph(g/s)
3) Volume of gas given off - gas syringe into beaker - substance reacts with liquid - record gas given out of beaker at regular intervals - more gas given off, quicker the reaction (cm^3s^-1)- plot a graph
Graphs - gradient of the line at any point on a reaction/time graph = rate of reaction - steeper the gradient | faster the reaction

Turbidity - cloudiness/clearness of a liquid
Mean rate of reaction = amount of reactant used|product formed / time 
Closed system - nothing can escape or enter the system
Equilibrium - when the concentration of the reactants and products are balanced and wont change. - only in a 'closed system' - a balance is a reversible reaction - forward reaction happens at same rate as backward reaction
 - the position of equilibrium can lie to the left or right(reactants or products) - depending on factors:
   1) Temperature - INCREASE temperature = equilibrium move to ENDOTHERMIC reaction - use more heat
                  - DECREASE temperature = equilibrium move to EXOTHERMIC reaction - produce more heat
                  - You will get more product for wherever the equilibrium is, and fewer of the other reactant.
   2) Pressure (gases) - INCREASE pressure = equilibrium moves in direction of FEWEST gas molecules, to reduce pressure
                       - DECREASE pressure = equilibrium moves in direction of MOST gas molecules - to increase pressure
   3) Concentration - removing product from one side shifts equilibrium to that side
Le Chatelier's principle - the equilibrium position can be changed if a change in conditions is introduced to the system
- In reversible reactions, reaction can be endo/exothermic. If reaction is endothermic in one direction, it is exothermic in the other. (vice versa)
```

## C9 - Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbon - any compound formed from carbon and hydrogen atoms only - simplest organic compound
Alkanes - simplest hydrocarbon - C(n)H(2n+2) - homologous series(all react similarly) - saturated compounds - each carbon atom form four single covalent bonds - (meth-ane, eth-ane, prop-ane, but-ane)
Alkene - C(n)H(2n) - more reactive than Alkanes - (methene, ethene, propene, butene, pentene)  - atleast ONE double-covalent bond (Unsaturated)
Short Chains -------------------> Long chains:
- LOWER boiling points  -----> higher boiling points
- LESS viscosity - runny ----> more viscosity - thick
- MORE volatile(tendency to turn into gas) --> less volatile
- MORE flammable -----------> less flammable
- cleaner flame -------------> smokier flame
Complete combustion - excess of oxygen. releases a lot of energy. Waste products- carbon dioxide + water. Carbon and hydrogen are both oxidised. 
    - hydrocarbon + lots of oxygen --> carbon dioxide + water (+energy)
    - Hydrocarbons used as fuels due to amount of energy they release.
Incomplete combustion - lack of oxygen - produces also carbon monoxide and carbon. Less energy released.
  - alkane + (low) oxygen ---> carbon monoxide + carbon dioxide + water (+(low) energy)
Hydrocarbons: used for: solvents, lubricants, detergents, 
 + POLYMERS - used for plastics - from alkenes(not alkanes)
Crude Oil - fossil fuel - remains of plants/animals, plankton compressed underground millions of years ago.| mixture of many hydrocarbons - most alkanes.
Fractional distillation - how to separate fractions of crude oil - oil heated from bottom - top. Longer chains condense first as higher BP. From top - bottom: 1) LPG(Liquiefied petroleum gas) - heating/cooking appliances
1) Petrol - cars
2) Kerosene - planes/jet fuel
3) Diesel Oil - cars
4) Lubricating/heating/heavy fuel oil - large ships
5) Bitumen - roads
- Each fraction is a mixture of hydrocarbons - all contain similar amount of carbon atoms - similar boiling points

Testing for alkenes:
- bromine water - alkenes turn from orange/brown --> colourless || Alkane stays orange
    - bromine atoms bond & break alkene double bond - becomes saturated
    - Chlorine & iodine similar || water reacts to make alcohol (ethanol)

Cracking:
- more demand for shorter alkanes - breaks alkanes --> alkene + shorter alkane
Catalytic cracking - 550oC - Zeolite catalyst
steam cracking - >800oC - no catalyst
butane (C.4H.10) ---> ethane(C.2H.6) + ethene(C.2H.4) || methane (CH4) + propene(C3H6)

## C10 - Chemical analysis
Pure substance - very specific melt/boiling points
Formulations - mixtures of certain amounts of substances for purpose eg: Paints, fuels, alloys, fertilisers
Chromatography - separating dyes and ink in a mixture - solvent line needs to be on ink line, ink line in pencil, lid needed
 - Rf value = distance for dot/ distance for solvent - varies from 0-1
 - mobile phase(water) moves up stationary phase(paper) by capillary action - lighter particles move further up
Gases test:
- Hydrogen - burning splint - 'pop'
- Oxygen - relight glowing splint
- Chlorine - bleaches damp blue litmus paper
- Carbon dioxide - turn limewater cloudy


## C12 - The Atmosphere
### Evolution of atmosphere:
```
Phase 1 - Volcanoes gave out gases:
- first billion years, earth covered in volcanoes - erupted & released gases - early atmosphere consisted of mostly carbon dioxide -some nitrogen, water vapour -small amounts of methane& ammonia -  no oxygen

Phase 2 - Oceans, Algae, plants absorbed CO2 - water vapour condensed, formed oceans - much carbon dioxide removed from atmosphere, dissolved in oceans -went through series of reactions -form carbonate precipitates - formed sediments on seabed.
- marine animals evolved -shells & skeletons contained carbonates from ocean
- Plants & algae evolved - absorbed some carbon dioxide to carry out photosynthesis
- Carbon trapped in fossil fuels & rocks after death - plants/plankton/marine animals die, fall onto seabed, get buried by layers of sediment. Over millions of years, compress & form sedimentary rocks, oil and gas - FOSSIL FUELS(contain trapped carbon)
  - Crude oil & natural gas formed from plankton - form reservoirs under seabed when trapped in rocks
  - Coal - sedimentary rock - from thick plant deposits
  - Limestone - sedimentary - mostly made of calcium carbonate deposits - from shells and skeletons of marine animals

Phase 3 - Plants & Algae produce OXYGEN - learnt photosynthesis:
- learnt how to use light to convert CO2 into water and sugars - carbon dioxide + water --> glucose + oxygen
- Algae evolved first - 2.7 billion yrs ago, over next billion years, green plants also evolved
- as oxygen levels built up in atmosphere, more complex life could evolve
- about 200 million years ago, atmosphere reached a composition similar to today:
  - 78% - Nitrogen 
  - 21% - Oxygen
  - 0.9% - Argon, Carbon dioxide - 0.04, Water vapour ???
- Coal formed from early CO2 through trees (photosynthesis) dying & compressing over millions of years
Bioleaching - extracts metals from low grade ores with living organisms - uses bacteria to produce solutions of copper compounds - copper obtained by displacement/electrolysis
```

### Greenhouse gases: 
Greenhouse gases - methane, carbon dioxide, water vapour - absorb long wavelength radiation thats reflected off the Earth - re-radiate it in all directions(including back towards earth)
Greenhouse effect - sun shines short wavelength radiation to earth, long wavelength (thermal radiation) reflected back - insulating layer of greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit it back into earth - heats the earth
Human activity affecting greenhouse gases:
- Deforestation - fewer trees = less CO2 being absorbed by photosynthesis = more CO2 in air
- Burning fossil fuels - carbon 'locked up' in fossil fuels released as CO2
- Agriculture - more farm animals produce methane - digestive waste
- Creating waste - landfill sites & waste from agriculture - more CO2 and methane released from decomposition of waste

Pollutants:
Carbon monoxide - binds to haemoglobin - reduces oxygen able to transport around body - odourless + colourless
sulphur dioxide - acid rain
nitrogen oxide - breathing problems
carbon/soot - health problems

## C13 - Resources
Need for: warmth, food, shelter, transport
 - natural resources: wood - shelter, fuels, materials - clothing
###  Potable Water & Groundwater
Potable - drinkable
Groundwater - easier to obtain, fewer processes:
  - filtered through filter beds - remove insoluble particles
  - sterilised - using chlorine, ozone or uv light - kills bacteria
  - desalination - removing salt from seawater - distillation/reverse osmosis - req. alot of energy
Waste water - harder to obtain, more processes:
  - screening & grit removal - remove large particles
  - Sedimentation - produce sewage sludge and effluent
  - Aerobic treatment of effluent - reduces solid waste
  - Sterilised - chlorine, ozone, uv light - kill bacteria
  - Sludge anaerobically digested by specific bacteria - removes organic matter

Extracting metals:
- demand huge
- pure metal obtained by electrolysis/ carbon displacement - from ore
Copper:
- phytomining - plants absorb copper ions in roots, burn - copper left in ash
- bioleaching - bacteria make leachate solutions - contain copper compounds
  - both very low yields - not effective

Life cycle assessment - impact of new product on environment:
Factors:
1. extraction & processing of raw materials
2. manufacturing, packaging
3. lifetime use
4. disposal
5. transportation
Reduce impact by:
1. Use product less
2. reduce material/energy needed to make
3. recycling


## Conversion Units
Concentration = mass/volume(g/dm3)
 - 1 dm3 = 1000 cm3
mol/dm3 --> g/dm3 = x by Relative formula mass
g/dm3 --> mol/dm3 = / by relative formula mass
mega = x 1,000,000
kilo = x 1000
milli = /1,000
micro = /1,000,000
nano = /1,000,000,000

## Any practicals:
To find order of reactivity of 3 metals - temperature change with HCl:
1) Measure amount of HCl with measuring cylinder, pour into a polystyrene cup
2) Measure initial temperature of HCl with thermometer
3) Get first metal and add it into cup - quickly put a lid over, poke thermometer through and stir
4) Measure highest temperature reached and calculate temp. change
5) Repeat for each metal, with all same - amount of HCl, mass & state of metal, inital temp. (or add more alkali solution)
6) Record results and rank metals in order of reactivity, with most reactive metal having most temperature change
7) If finding volume needed to neutralise, plot max temp against vol of alkali, where temp starts to drop = volume needed
 
#### Making salt crystals - copper sulfate
2) Take copper oxide, mix with heated sulphuric acid in a beaker to cause neutralisation reaction - produces copper sulphate solution
3) Add excess copper oxide - some at bottom, then filter out
4) Heat solution in evaporating basin ontop of a beaker (of boiling water) on a tripod & bunsen burner & gauze
5) Wait till half is gone, then wait 24 hrs for crystals. Scrape crystals on paper towel and dry

#### Electrolysis:
1) Put petri dish lid with 2 holes. Carbon (inert) electrodes in 50cm3 aqueous solution with salt. Connect electrodes to battery/power supply with crocodile clips
2) Explain products formed at each electrode - Look at C6 equation

#### Titration:
1) 50cm3 of alkali with pipette, in conical flask - add methly orange indicator (pink/red in acid)
2) Fill burette with acid to 0cm3 - slowly add drops of acid until alkali STAYS pink, even when swirled - neutralisation occurs

    **Atoms**
    
    - Atoms are made up of 3 subatomic particles:
        - Protons
            - Protons have a positive charge
            - A proton has a relative mass of 1 and a relative charge of +1
            - The protons are found in the nucleus
        - Neutrons
            - Neutrons have a neutral charge and they are neither positive or negative
            - A neutron has a relative mass of 1 and a relative charge of 0.
            - Neutrons are also found in the nucleus.
        - Electrons
            - Electrons have a negative charge.
            - Electrons have a relative mass of 1/2000 (or 0.0005), but sometimes you can just say 0, and have a relative charge of -1.
            - Electrons orbit the nucleus of the atom in shells.
    - Most of the mass in an atom is concentrated in the nucleus.
    - The nucleus is where the protons and neutrons are.
    - The nucleus has an overall positive charge.
    - The amount of protons in an atom is the same as the amount of electrons.
    - History of The Atom
        - In 1803, **John Dalton** discovered atoms and described them as solid spheres, and that different spheres make different elements.
        - In 1897, **J.J Thompson** discovered electrons. This showed that atoms weren't solid and indivisible. The 'solid sphere' idea of atomic structure had to be changed. The new model was known as the 'Plum Pudding Model'
        - In 1909, **Ernest Rutherford** and his students Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden conducted their famous gold foil [experiment.](http://experiment.Th) They fired positively charged alpha particles at a very thin sheet of gold. Some particles passed through and some deflected back so he made the 'nuclear model' where a positively charged nucleus was surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons.
        - Then **Niels Bohr** saw that in the nuclear model the electrons would quickly spiral down into the nucleus, causing the atom to collapse. He proposed a new model of the atom where electrons exist in shells or orbits of fixed energy.
    
    **Elements**
    
    - All elements are made up of one type of atom.
    - Elements all have their element symbol, the atomic number and the Mass number.
        - The Atomic number is the smaller number in either the top or bottom left corner. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus.
        - The Mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom. The mass number is always the bigger number.
        - To find the amount of neutrons in an atom  you do mass number - atomic number.
    - An ion is an atom that has lost or gained electrons. Negative ions have more electrons than protons because they have gained an electron. Positive ions have fewer electrons but still the same number of protons. You cant lose or gain protons, only electrons.
- C2 - Periodic Table
    - History of the periodic table
        - John Newlands
            - Created the first periodic table in 1864
            - He ordered them by atomic weight
            - The table was incomplete and some elements were placed in wrong groups
        - Dimitri Mendeleev
            - He added gaps to John Newlands table for undiscovered elements
            - He predicted the properties and masses of these undiscovered elements
        - Dimitri Mendeleev started the development of the periodic table, arranging elements by atomic mass. He predicted the discovery of other elements and left gaps for them.
        - John Newlands made the law of octaves in the periodic table
    - Group 1
        - The trend in Group 1 is that when you go down the group, the elements get more reactive because the outer electron gets further away from the nucleus and loses its electro-static force. This means that it is easier to lose that outer electron and react.
        - Group 1 elements are called Alkali metals
        - Group 1 elements react with oxygen so you have to store them in oil.
            - As you go down the group, the melting and boiling points get lower and lower because as the ions get larger the distance between the electron and positive nucleus gets further, reducing the overall attraction.
        - Group 1 elements only have 1 electron on the outer shell so to react they just have to lose their 1 electron.
    - Group 7
        - The trend in group 7 Halogens gets less reactive going down the group because the amount of electron shielding increases (more electrons and shells), meaning that the electron is less attracted to the nucleus. This makes it harder to react.
        - Group 7 elements are called Halogens.
        - Group 7 elements all require one more electron to obtain a full outer shell and become stable. They need to react with another atom and share an electron to become stable and form a covalent bond.
            - Group 7 elements react by gaining an electron.  When halogens react they form halides.
        - In Group 7, melting and boiling points increase going down the group
    - Group 0
        - Noble Gases
        - They are unreactive because they have a full outer shell
    - Metals are found on the left side of the periodic table because they have few electrons on their outer shell.
    - Non-Metals are found in the right side because they have many electrons on their outer shell
    
- C3 - Bonding and Structure
    - Ionic bonding
        - bonding between metals and non-metals
        - attraction between oppositely charged ions
        - The ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between a positively charged metal ion and a negatively charged non-metal ion
        - Ionic compounds form giant ionic lattices that are held together by strong electrostatic forces called ionic bonds
    - Covalent bonding
        - Bonding between non-metals
        - Involves atoms sharing electrons to make the outer shells become stable.
        - The covalent bonds in polymers are strong.
        - Covalent bonds are stronger than intermolecular forces
    - Metallic bonding
        - an attraction between positively charged ions and negative delocalised electrons
        - Bonding in metals
        - The Metallic bond is the force of attraction between the delocalised free-moving electrons and positive metal ions.
        - Metallic bonds are strong so they can contain a solid structure
        - They usually have high melting and boiling points because there are a lot of bonds to be broken
    - Positive ions are called cations
    - Negative ions are called anions
    - Group 1 metals always lose 1 electron and become a positive ion
    - Group 2 metals always lose 2 electrons and become a +2 ion
    - Group 6 and 7 metals always gain electrons to become negative ions
    - Small molecules have weak intermolecular forces. This means that they have low melting and boiling points.
    - Small molecules are often liquids or gases at room temperature.
    - Small molecules cannot conduct electricity because they don't contain delocalised electrons
    - An example of a small molecule is Chlorine
    - Bigger molecules attract other molecules with strong intermolecular forces.
    - Bigger molecules have higher melting and boiling points than small molecules.
    - Bigger molecules still don't conduct electricity because they don't contain delocalised electrons
    - Because ions are in layers, they slide over each other easily when a force is applied
    - Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity because their delocalised electron can carry both charge and heat.
    - Allotrope - a substance made up of the same element but in a different arrangement
    - Buckminsterfullerene - Formula of C60 and is spherical
    - Diamond
        - Made up of carbon atoms - Allotrope
        - Diamond has a very high melting and boiling points - this is because a lot of heat energy is needed to break the covalent bonds.
        - Diamond cannot conduct electricity - there are no free electrons or ions to carry a charge
        - Diamond is very hard and has alot of covalent bonds
        - Each carbon atom is bonded to 4 other carbon atoms by strong covalent bonds
    - Graphite
        - Graphite is soft and slippery
        - layers can easily slide over each other because the weak force of intermolecular forces is easily broken. This is why graphite is used as a lubricant
        - Graphite conducts electricity - the free electron from each carbon means that each layer has delocalised electrons, which can carry charge.
        - Graphite is the only non-metal to conduct electricity.
        - Each carbon atom in graphite is bonded to 3 other carbon atoms by stong covalent bonds
        - Each layer is held together by intermolecular forces, which is why the layers slide over each other easily.
