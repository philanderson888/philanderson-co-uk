Gradient - change in y/change in x = y2-y1/x2-x1
Speed = distance/time
Acceleration = change in velocity/time
Midpoint of a line = (x1 + x2/2 , y1 + y2/2)
Area of a trapezium = 1/2 (a+b) x height
Volume of any prism = length x Cross-section area
Cross-section area = width x height

Permutations - combinations or different arrangements
Binomial - expression that has two terms
Coefficient - number before variable in expression (no equals)
Hyperbola - curve in graph
Relative freq. - probabilities based on results
Invariant - points that don't change after transformation
Equidistant - same distance
Elevation - 2d view of 3d solid, viewed from front or side
Frequency polygon - graph joining midpoints of data groups
Geometric sequence - each term is product of previous term and constant(r) - an = a1 x (r)^n-1
Arithmetic - numbers with a common difference - normal sequence
Completing square - quadratic in form: (x + b/2)^2 + (b/2)^2 + c (Simplified = (x+a)2 + b)
Turning point - (x+a)2 + b (completed square) in form: (-a, b) (Maximum = if a is negative in quadratic)
Continous data - can take any value within range
Discrete data - only take certain values in given range (e.g goals scored)
Cosine rule - a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc x cos(a)
            - Cos(A) = b2+c2 - a2 / 2bc
Used when: 1) Three sides, 2) Two sides and included angle
Sine rule = Sin(A)/a = Sin(B)/b 
Used when: 1) Two angles and one side, 2) Two sides and non-included angle
Arc - section of circumference circle
Bisector - line that divided line exactly in half
```

## Probability
```
Mutually exclusive - events that can't happen at the same time
Exhaustive events - all the outcomes are included - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
Independant events - the outcome doesnt depend on the other - P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
Dependant events - when one outcome depends on the other
A' - complement a - NOT a
A n B - intercept - a AND b - middle of venn diagram
A u B - union - A or B - both circles
```
## Proportion & Compound measures
```
Direct proportion - when one value increase with the other - y = Kx
Inverse proportion - when one value increases as the other decreases - y = K/x
Constant of proportionality - represented as 'k' - the relatio  n between two proportional numbers


1 Interior + 1 exterior = 180
All exterior = 360
Total interior angles = (n-2) x 180 (n=no. of sides)
Compound measure - measure involves two+ other measures
Pressure = force/area
Congruent - same shape and size
Mean in a table = multiply groups x frequency, divide that by n(no.of people in table)
    - if group has range, find midpoint x frequency, divide it by n
Linear scale factor
Area scale factor = Linear squared
Volume SF = Linear cubed
Reciprocal - 1 divided by number (reciprocal of 5 = 1 divided by 5 = 1/5)
Bearing - angle, clockwise from North of a point
```
### Circle Theroems 
1) Angles subtended by same arc are equal
2) Angle at centre twice angle at circumference
3) Angle in a semicircle is 90 degrees - triangle in semi-circle = right-angled
4) Alternate segment - angle between tangent and chord is equal to angle subtended by chord
5) Cyclic quadrilateral - opposite angles in a quadrilateral = 180
6) Angle between tangent and radius = 90
7) Tangents that meet at point = equal in length
8) Perpendicular of a chord that goes through centre, bisects chord

### Vectors
Two vectors(a,b) are parallel if a = k x b (if they are multiples)

### Congruent triangles
5 ways to prove congruent:
SSS - Side-Side-Side
SAS - Side-Angle-Side - angle inbetween two sides same
AAS - two angles & side not between angles same
ASA - two angles & side between angles same
HL (right-angled) - Hypotenuse-Leg - Hypotenuse and one other side same

### Transformations
#### Reflection
- each point is same distance from mirror line
#### Rotation
Three pieces needed to rotate shape:
- Centre of rotation
- Direction - anti/clockwise
- Angle 
Each corner always same distance from centre of rotation
#### Translation
- Column vectors used - x first, then y (x=horizontal, y=vertical)
#### Enlargement
- When a shape enlarged from C.O Enlargement, distance from centre to point is multiplied by scale factor
2 pieces needed to enlarge shape:
 - Scale factor
 - Centre of enlargement
- A positive(>1) scale factor increases size of shape
- A fractional enlargement decreases shape size - shape also closer COE
- A negative scale factor - shape on other side on COE - shape upside down - shape is still bigger
### Area, Length, Volume SF
Area SF = Length squared
Volume SF = Length cubed
Length SF = Root (Area) \\ Cubed root (Volume)

###  y = f(x) graphs
y = f(-x) == reflection in Y-AXIS, y not affected
y = -f(x) == reflection in X-AXIS, x not affected, y affected

```
Congruent - when two shapes are identical in shape and angles and form.
Parallel - two lines that are straight and never meet
Polygon - a polygon  is a plane figure that is formed by three or more straight lines called
sides because no shape has two or one sides.
Perpendicular - A line that is at a 90-degree angle on a line that makes a right angle
Right angle - A 90-degree angle 
Acute angle - An angle
Quadratic 
equation - a math problem
Calculate - to work out and find a result of something
Horizontal - going West to East or the other way round.
Vertical - going North to South or the other way round.
Oriented - to align and position something in line to their points of a compass  or other 
specific positions
Column - a row that goes vertically  across something like in a grid there are rows
(horizontal lines) columns (vertical lines)
Angle - the position of something or where it is compared to another point or place
