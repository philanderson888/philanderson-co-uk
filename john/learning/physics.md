### Forces & exchange particles

- For particles to interact, 1 of 4 Fundamental forces and exchange particle must be involved, 
1) Gravity - weakest - only particles with mass - inf range
2) Weak nuclear force - affects all particles - smallest range (10^-18m)
3) Electromagnetic - only on charged particles - inf range
4) Strong nuclear force - only hadron - strongest - range of only 10^-15m

Exchange particles (aka virtual particles):

 - When 2 particles interact, an exchange particle passes between them - impossible for instant action over a distance acts as a force carrier between particles
 - Only exists for very brief moment, only role to carry force between particles.
	- Repulsion - As exchange particle goes from one particle to another, it ‘repels’ to conserve momentum
    - Attraction - exchange particle goes around and carries force into each other to attract them closer together.   



Gauge Bosons:

Each fundamental force has its own exchange particle - called gauge bosons - virtual photons, W bosons, pions
- Mass of gauge boson affects range of force

Virtual photons:
- For Electromagnetic interaction, 
- 0 mass - giving force an infinite range

Pions:
- For Strong nuclear interaction between nucleons. 
- Relatively heavy - small range
- Strong nuclear force involved in quarks - use gluons instead

W bosons (W+ and W-):
- For Weak nuclear interaction 
- Weigh around 100x more than proton - heaviest - smallest range as large amount of energy needed to create exchange particle, so exists shortly and travels short distance

Gravity - very weak, not considered in particle interactions - theoretical particle called graviton

Feymann diagrams:
- represent particle interactions - show incoming, outgoing particles + exchange particle
Rules:
1) vertical (y) axis = time || incoming particles start at bottom
2) horizontal (x) axis = space
3) Particles have straight lines, gauge bosons have wiggly 'wave' lines - lines dont cross
4) All straight lines must have arrow direction || **charged** gauge bosons need an arrow direction, normal dont
5) Baryon & lepton number & total charge must be conserved on each side
- line distances, angles are not important

Electromagnetic repulsion:
- 2 particles of same charge near, electromagnetically repel - exchange a virtual photon

Beta-plus decay:
- proton turning into neutron, positron and neutrino released - W+ boson exchanged
- p --> n + e+ + v↓e

Beta-minus decay:
- neutron to proton, electron and antineutrino released - W- boson exchanged
- n --> p + e- + ̅νe

- protons & electrons can interact through weak interaction through: electron capture & proton collisions
- both have same decay equation: p + e- --> n + ve  (both release neutron + neutrino)
Electron capture - electron absorbed by proton in nucleus - proton decays to neutron + neutrino released - W+ boson
    - baryon number conserved on left side, lepton number conserved on right
Electron-proton collisions - electron collides with proton, neutron & neutrino released - W- boson, arrow in opposite direction (upwards)

Annihilation - particle & antiparticle collide - makes 2 photons in opposite directions
pair production - photon with nucleus - makes particle-antiparticle pair- photon energy atleast TWICE particle rest energy 



### Time graphs
##### Distance-time graphs:
Horizontal = stationary
positive gradient = constant speed
negative gradient = going backwards/opposite direction
Gradient = speed
##### Velocity-time graphs:
Horizontal line = constant velocity
positive gradient = accelerating (constant)
negative gradient = decelerating (constant)
Gradient = acceleration
Distance = area under graph
##### Acceleration

## P7 - Radioactivity
Alpha particle - 2 protons, 2 neutrons (helium nucleus) - travels 5cm in air - highly ionising(charge of +2) - stopped by paper 
Beta particle - 1 fast electron - travels 1m in air - midly ionising(charge of -1) - stopped by aluminium/metal foil
Gamma wave - electromagnetic wave - infinite distance - low ionising, no charge - stopped by thick lead or metres of concrete
Radioactive decay - unstable nuclei emitting a type of radiation to become stable
Alpha decay - atoms have very large nuclei - unstable - have to release alpha particles
Beta decay - small atoms have too few protons compared to neutrons - unstable - have to release electrons - turns neutrons into protons
Ionise - to charge atoms
Activity - rate of decay - Becquerels(Bq) - short half-life means high rate of activity
Irradiation - being exposed to radiation, doesnt become radioactive
Contaminated - radioactive atoms are on/in that object - can be dangerous if radioactivity gets inside your body
Geiger counter - method to measure activity - counts
Half-life - time it takes for the amount of radioactive nuclei to halve - (time for activity to halve)
Isotope - element with same protons but different neutrons

## Physics paper 2 vid
Scalar & Vectors:
Contact force - physically touching (friction, air resistance)
Non-contact force - not touching (magnetic, gravity, electrostatic force)
Scalar - quantity  - only has MAGNITUDE (size) - distance, speed, mass, temperature
Vector - quantity - has magnitude and DIRECTION - displacement, velocity, acceleration, force
Resultant vector - adding them (can be negative) - if at right angles, use pythagoras. 
 - if resultant = 0, means no acceleration - can still be moving
Weight = force that gravity pulls an object down with
work done = energy transferred by a force
Springs:
- any object that deforms elastically obeys hooke's law (force & extension are directly proportional)
Practical:
1. add weight (1kg = 10N) onto a spring
2. Measure extension with ruler at each weight
3. Plot a graph of force against extension, gradient = spring constant
4. Avoid systematic error by lining up 0cm with bottom of spring, parallax by measuring on eye level

Moment (Nm) = force x distance from pivot (m)
Principle of moments - total of clockwise moment = total of anti-clockwise moment - equilibrium, doesn't turn
Gears - used to increase moments - drive large gear w smaller one - doulbe diameter = double moment

Graphs:
Distance/Displacement - time graph - gradient = speed/velocity (v)
Speed/v - time graph - gradient = acceleration (m/s^2) || negative gradient = decelerating
 - area under graph = distance

s - displacement(m)
u - initial velocity (m/s)
v - final 
t - time (s)
a - acceleration (m/s²)
- formula u get - v² - u² = 2as
Formulas u might not need: v = u + at || s = (u+v/2) x t
- if starts at rest, u = 0, if stops, v = 0

## Newtons Laws of motion
1st - if no resultant force acts on an object, its motion wont change
inertia - tendency for an object's motion to stay constant when no force
2nd - F = ma
 - Practical: Accelerate a trolley on a track with mass on a string over pulley 
 - 2. Use light/photogates at 2 points to measure acceleration
 - 3. Change force by removing mass & placing on trolley - keep total mass same
 - Plot F against acceleration, gradient = total mass
3rd - for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction - NOT balanced forces


## P10
Acceleration due to gravity - freefalling acceleration - 9.81m/s² (10m/s²)
Air resistance - frictional force with air - slows a falling object - increases as speed of object increases
Terminal velocity - the fastest an object can fall - when the air resistance is equal to the weight of an object, the object stops accelerating - it is at a constant 'terminal' velocity
Momentum = mass x velocity (p = mv) (kgm/s)
Conservation of momentum - momentum is not created or destroyed in a closed system
 - rebounds - m1 u1 = m1v1 + m2v2 (m = object 1/2, u = initial v, v = final)
 - joining - m1 u1 = mv
 - recoil - 0 = m1 v1 + m2 v2
Stopping distance - time it takes for a car to stop in an emergency = thinking distance + braking distance
Thinking distance - distance car travels between their reaction time = speed x reaction time
 - 2x speed = 2x thinking distance
- Factors affecting reaction time - 1) Drugs/Alcohol, 2) Distractions, 3) Tiredness
Braking distance - distance car travels between applying brake and it stops
 - 2x speed = 4x braking distance
 - Factors affecting braking distance - 1) Car's brakes or tyres, 2) car speed (proportional), 3) road conditions
Work done, when braking = inital kinetic energy = 1/2 mass x velocity^2 (Work = force x distance)
Force needed to stop car = 1/2 mv2 / distance
Force = momentum change / time
Inertia - how difficult it is to change an object's motion - high mass = high inertia

## Waves

Waves - transfer energy through a medium without transferring any matter
Longitudinal waves - oscillations/vibrations parallel to direction of energy transfer(forward) - Sound waves eg ultrasound, Shock waves - Compressions & rarefractions (spread out)
Transerve waves - vibrations(up, down) perpendicular to direction of energy transfer(forward) - all EM waves, ripples/waves in water, seismic waves
 - x-axis = equilibrium (time or distance), y-axis = displacement
 - Sound: frequency = pitch, amplitude = volume
Wave speed - speed energy is being transferred = Frequency x wavelength
period - time for one wave to pass
Frequency - number of waves passing every second
- speed of sound waves in air = 330 m/s
Practicals:
Ripple tank:
- set motor dipper to low frequency (20Hz)
- use a light and paper underneath to see waves
- measure distance of 10 waves, divide by 10 to get wavelength
- use formula v = fxwavelength to find speed
- Wave on string:
  - oscillator/vibration generator attached to a string with mass on end over a pulley
  - change frequency until simplest stationary wave formed (one loop) - wavelength = 2 x string length
Sound waves:
- attach microphone to oscilloscope
- clap next to microphone, sound echos off wall & back a known distance away
- measure time it took, use sound = d/t 

Earth's temperature:
absorbing > emitting = temp increasing
absorbing = emitting - constant
absorbing < emitting - decreasing
depends on rate of light and IR radiation emitted & absorbed by earth's surface/atmosphere
high frequency IR absorbed by earth, low freq reflected (greenhouse)

EM Spectrum:
1. Radio - communication - Phones, TV, Wifi
 - transmitted easily through air, reflectable - creates a.c when absorbed
2. Micro - cooking, satellites
 - easily absorbed by food, pass easily through atmosphere
3. Infra-red - cooking(absorbed by surface)
 - all objects emit infra-red light - heat - absorbed by chemical bonds, heating them up
4. Visible light
 - used in fibre optics - glass fibre to receiver
5. Ultra-violet - tan, can cause skin cancer
6. X-rays - medical scans, dangerous - cause mutations, cancer
7. Gamma rays - sterilising, tumour treatment, dangerous - mutations,cancer

- EM transfer energy as radiation, can travel through vacuum
- EM waves emitted when electrons lose energy, absorbed by electrons (not gamma - emmited by nuclei)
- EM waves travel at 300 million m/s through a vacuum
- Ionising radiation - when energy of wave is high enough, it removes electrons, ionising atoms (UV, x-ray, gamma)
  - 1000 mSv = 1 Sv

Practical: show Matte black best Infra-red(IR) emitter & absorber:
1. use leslie cube on heat resistant mat - fill to top with boiling water, replace lid, leave for 1 min
2. use IR thermometer/detector to measure each side - plot bar graph.
3. use ruler to make sure distance same each time
 - shiny materials the worst emitters/absorbers - matte black best
Absorbtion: shine light at test tubes with thermometer, wrapped around different materials - same distance - dark = best absorb

### Reflection & Refraction
Reflection:
Angle of Incidence = angle of reflection
- Normal - line perpendicular to surface
- angle of incidence - angle between ray and normal (AOI)
- angle of refraction - between reflected/fracted ray and normal
- Diffuse reflection: rough surface - light scattered, distorted image (water)

Refraction:
- when waves enter a new medium, speed & angle changes
- wavelength changes, frequency stays same
- light disperses through prism - different wavelength refracted different amounts - violet most(high freq.), red least
- only need to draw rays, not wavefronts
- when wave slows dows, bends towards Normal - angle of refraction smaller than AOI
- denser the medium, slower light travels

## Electromagnets
- When current flows through coil it produces a magnetic field
- cant turn permanent magnet off, can turn electromagnet off
- direction of current wont change strength of electromagnet
- solenoid - core with coil wrapped around it + North and South pole
- Steel - hard to magnetise, keeps its magnetism
- Iron - easily magnetised, loses its magnetism easily

Permanent magnet - molecules permanently aligned, always produce field
induced - magnetised when in another field - magnetic
- mini compasses/iron filings put in magnetic field to visualise 
Field lines always go from NORTH to SOUTH pole - always complete loops, never touch
Iron, cobalt, nickel, steel = magnetic (can be induced magnets) - attract to either pole
Motor effect - right-hand rule:
- a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field will experience a force
- fingers = field direction (Tesla), thumb = wire/current direction
- if wire parallel to field lines = no force
Fleming's left-hand rule - direction of force:
- Thumb = force - F
- 1st/index finger = field - B
- 2nd/middle = currect - I
- make a gun with all 3 perpendicular - FBI
Practical: finding flux density
1. place magnet on balance, tare, measure mass - convert to Newtons
2. Measure length of wire
3. Measure current with ammeter
4. rearrange F = BIL to find B (B = F/IL)

Motors:
both sides of coil experience force in opposite direction, turns
- split-ring communicator needed to ensure current reversed every half-turn to keep coil spinning (current always + to -)
To increase motor speed:
- add more turns to coil
- increase current
- use stronger magnet
Loudspeaker:
- motor that goes back and forth 
- current sent from source causes coil to vibrate, causes speaker cone to vibrate, producing sound waves
